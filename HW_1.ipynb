The law, seen by many as discriminatory, has prompted the NBA, NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference to move major sporting events out of the state, costs that the former secretary of state said, \"We can\\'t afford.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen,\" she said. \"And if anyone wonders what is the cost of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina, look at what\\'s happening with the NCAA and the ACC.

Some nourished him, some, he found cured his ills, and some killed him. Few, to his surprise, had strange effects on his mind and body, seeming to carry him onto other worlds. We call these plants hallucinogens, because they distort the senses and usually produce hallucinations--experiences that depart from reality. Although most hallucinations are visual, they may also involve the senses of hearing, touch, smell, or taste--and occasionally several senses simultaneously...\"\\n\\n1 Schultes, The compounds that we call \"hallucinogenic\" are drugs that modify the function of the central nervous system by altering the input from the senses and changing the mood and behavior of the individual. These short term effects have caused some concern among our parents and leaders, but it is the long term influence that we will consider here. \"In the history of mankind, hallucinogens have probably been the most important of all the narcotics. Their fantastic effects made them sacred to primitive man and may even have been responsible for suggesting to him the idea of deity.\"\\n\\n2 Schultes, Dr. Richard Evan Schultes was no drug crazed hippy, but a respected Harvard professor with impeccable credentials. It was apparent to Dr. Schultes that hallucinogens were deeply involved in early religions. He also understood that to broadcast such views could be hazardous to one\\'s career. Hence he confined his revolutionary discovery to one line in a popular guide to plant identification rather than publishing in some academic journal. When etymologist John Allegro went public with his discoveries linking early Christianity to hallucinogenic mushrooms, his career was ruined. It is indeed a subject that can cause deep emotional reaction. That was one of the early tipoffs that something important was going on here. There were such extreme reactions to inquiries about mushrooms that researchers had to come up with terms to describe mushroom haters and lovers. Whole cultures can be categorized by their view as to whether certain mushrooms are considered food or poison. Besides religion, the study involves ritual cannibalism, sex, and behavior modification. All of this is dangerous territory and may cause strong emotional reactions in the reader. If you DO have an emotional reaction to any of this material, you should sit very still, breath deeply and try to relax. Try to identify your feelings. Are you feeling anger? Frustration? Fear? Hatred? If these feelings are strong, you may want to quit reading. But please don\\'t be mad at me. I\\'m just telling it like I see it. A certain amount of denial is necessary for survival in these troubling times. In order to function we all need a solid emotional state from which to operate. Like it or not, our basic beliefs, our \"World View\", is a major component of said state. Messing with your core beliefs can be tricky business. It hurts. It can cause damage; but so can ignoring the Truth. The trick is to use denial to keep your peace of mind, being careful not to be crushed by the Truth when it lands on you. Our beliefs are what holds us together. When the leaders we trust turn out to be liars, thieves and murders, it can shake our confidence and certainly be painful. The feeling of betrayal can lead to nearly uncontrollable anger. When our Gods betray us, it may be too much for some people to bear. Some folks might be better off if they just pass on this material and stick to their beliefs. Proceed at your own risk. However, if you are a seeker, and serious about \"meaning of life\" issues, you can\\'t afford to turn back now. <- About | Next -> Sources\\n\\n\\nClick on Author to return to quoted text. 1 Schultes, Hallucinogenic Plants, Golden Press, New York, 1976, p 5.\\n\\n2 Schultes, Hallucinogenic Plants, Golden Press, New York, 1976, p 5.'}, {'id': 255012, 'ended': True, 'length': 359, 'text': 'Having trouble viewing the video?

That chapter gives a complete review of the chart pattern, compared to what is described below.\\n\\nCup-with-Handle\\n\\nImportant Bull Market Results for Cup with Handle Overall performance rank (1 is best): not ranked Break even failure rate: 5% Average rise: 52% Throwback rate: 62% Percentage meeting price target: 62% The above numbers are based on 912 perfect trades. See the glossary for definitions.\\n\\nCup with Handle Identification Guidelines\\n\\nCharacteristic Discussion Price trend Upward leading to the pattern. I use a 6-month look back (high to high). If price is higher at pattern start than 6 months ago, then I accept it. Otherwise, I visually check to see it's in a short-term uptrend. I no longer require a 30% upward move. Shape A rounded turn that looks like a cup with a handle on the right. U-shaped cup The cup should be U-shaped, not V-shaped. Handle The cup must have a handle on the right. Cup duration From 7 to 65 weeks Handle duration 1 week minimum with no maximum. Handle Forms in upper half of cup. Cup Cup rims should be near the same price level but be flexible.\\n\\nCup with Handle Trading Tips\\n\\nConsult the associated figure on the right.\\n\\nTrading Tactic Explanation Measure rule Measure the height from the right cup lip ( A ) to the lowest valley ( B ) then multiply by the above 'percentage meeting price target.' Add the result to the breakout price ( A ) to get a target. Inner cup Cups often form within cups (points 1 and 2 ), so trade the inner cup when price rises above the handle (the dashed green line at point 3 ). Trendline If possible, draw a down-sloping trendline along the handle peaks. A close above the trendline signals an early buy. I show this as the blue line extending down from point A on the chart to the right. Buy Buy when price closes above the right cup rim (point A , and the top horizontal red line). Stop The handle low (point C ) is a good place to put a stop. Raise the stop as price rises. Throwbacks Throwbacks hurt performance. Short handle Stocks with handles shorter than the median 22 days show superior post breakout performance. The Measure Rule\\n\\nCup with Handle Example\\n\\nThe figure on the right shows an example of a cup with handle chart pattern. The rise leading to the cup with handle begins at C and reaches the left cup lip at point A . Since this is on the weekly scale, the price chart appears narrower than usual, but price rounds downward forming a cup with the right cup lip at B . The handle lasts a few weeks before price begins moving up. The next week, price rockets upward about seven points.\\n\\n-- Thomas Bulkowski\\n\\nOther Cup with Handle Examples\"}, {'id': 255021, 'ended': False, 'length': 1024, 'text': 'The Wolf currently has the former Seminole as his RB33, but expect Dalvin Cook to get a gigantic bump in the rankings after taking advantage of Latavius Murray\\'s absence during the first week of training camp. Cook is catching the eye of his teammates and coaches, and currently possesses workhorse potential in Minnesota.\\n\\nA succession of poor decisions off the field, ball security issues on the field and a mediocre combine dropped the uber-talented Dalvin Cook all the way to pick No. 41 to the Minnesota Vikings — who let Vikings legend and seven-time All-Pro Adrian Peterson walk in free agency, while adding goal line hammer Latavius Murray in March.\\n\\nAfter Christian McCaffrey came off the board, us at the Roto Street Journal were pleading for a team like the Bucs, Raiders or Packers to select Cook. Once the Vikings drafted Cook, the fantasy community broke out in a cold sweat. Minnesota does very little to help out their running backs: from their porous offensive line, to their up-and-down passing situation and blah-scheme, it\\'s tough to be a running back for the purple and gold.\\n\\nThe Wolf was especially hurt by this combination, stating:\\n\\nCook landed in arguably the worst spot possible with Minnesota. Indeed, the talent is there, but that\\'s about all he has working in his favor. The team dished out oodles of money for Latavius Murray, who will undoubtedly be involved, especially near the stripe. Additionally, the line is among the worst in football, and there\\'s little else really threatening defenses or creating TD opportunities. Throw in a bland, vanilla scheme, and Cook will be relying on his own high-end abilities to produce any fantasy value in 2017.\\n\\nAlthough Murray had the highest percentage of carries inside the 5-yard line last season (81.8 percent in Oakland), we didn\\'t take the severity of his ankle injury into account before grading out Cook\\'s situation. The reason why Murray took multiple free agent visits was to prove to teams in person that the bone spurs in his ankle were not serious, and the Vikings took the bait. The former Raider underwent surgery on his ankle a week after signing and was expected to be ready for the start of training camp.\\n\\nFast forward to the start of training camp, and Latavius Murray is still MIA. In fact, on July 31st, Murray put no timetable on his return and would only commit to the regular season. After missing the entire offseason program and the start of camp with his new team, a frustrated Murray stated that he\\'s \"behind the 8-ball.\" He went onto say, \"if I\\'m not healthy, there\\'s no point in me being out there. If I\\'m not good out there, I can\\'t help the team regardless.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, the rookie running back is taking full advantage of his opportunity by taking the majority of the first team reps and he\\'s caught the attention of his teammates and coaches.\\n\\n\"The first thing the veteran players I\\'ve talked to about him say is, \\'This guy gets it.\\'\" coach Mike Zimmer explained after a practice. \"He understands protections, he works hard, they see how he interacts in the locker room, and that\\'s part of it. And then, when you have a special player—like when we got [linebacker Anthony] Barr—they say, \\'Hey, man, this guy is different than other guys.\\' \"That\\'s kinda how he is. They see him out there on the field with the other guys, and it\\'s like, \\'There\\'s something different about this guy, the way he runs, accelerates, the creases he can get to.\\' He\\'s got a tough mentality. Players can see exceptional athletes. When they go out there and they\\'re going against guys, they can see: This guy is pretty good.\"\\n\\nAs one can see, it\\'s safe to say that Dalvin Cook has earned the staff\\'s trust, and with Murray still sidelined, he\\'s truly entering a workhorse role. The cause for concern is still there, as he has a tendency to fumble, and once Murray joins the team, he\\'s likely to vulture 7-10 touchdowns from the 5-foot-10, 210 lb rookie. The offensive line still sucks and the scheme is still as vanilla as can be, but with his elite pass catching skills, he could definitely see 250-plus touches. In fact, Vikings beat writer Matt Vensel of the Star Tribune said, \"don\\'t rule out\" 300 touches for the rookie.\\n\\nCook will bring big-play ability (10 50-plus yard runs at Florida State), elite hands for a runner (79 receptions in three seasons) and every-down potential (766 touches in three seasons) to a Vikings team that desperately needs a legitimate playmaker.

But amid all the scorn, one question has yet to be asked about the resiliency of the terror army, which actually goes to the heart of its decade-old war doctrine. Namely: Does ISIS actually win even when it loses?\\n\\nThis isn\\'t an academic issue. America\\'s allies in the ISIS war are gearing up for a major counteroffensive against the extremist group. That assault that could very well play right into ISIS\\'s hands.\\n\\nHaving superimposed its self-styled \"caliphate\" over a good third of Iraq\\'s territory, in control of two provincial capitals, ISIS is today in the strongest position it has ever been for fomenting the kind of sectarian conflagration its founding father, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, envisioned as far back as 2004.\\n\\nZarqawi\\'s end-game was simple: by waging merciless atrocities against Iraq\\'s Shia majority population (and any Sunnis seen to be conspiring with it), Zarqawi\\'s jihadists would have only to stand back and watch as radicalized Shia militias, many of whose members also served in various Iraqi government and security roles, conducted their own retaliatory campaigns against the country\\'s Sunni minority. Internecine conflict would have the knock-on effect of driving Sunnis desperately into the jihadist fold, whether or not they sympathized with the ideology of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Zarqawi\\'s franchise and the earliest incarnation of what we now call the Islamic State.\\n\\nIndeed, in the mid-2000s, the Jordanian jihadist nearly got what he wished for by waging spectacular terror attacks against Shia civilians and holy sites, such as the Golden Mosque in Samarra, a strategy which quickened devolved Iraq\\'s violence from a primarily anti-American insurgency into all-out civil war. The only stopgap for a truly apocalyptic or nation-destroying result was the presence of nearly 200,000 U.S. and coalition troops. Today, however, absent such a foreign and independent military presence, the main actors left in Iraq are the same extremists—Shia militias and ISIS.\\n\\nThis fact was only driven home last week after thousands of U.S.-trained Iraqi Security Force personnel, including the elite counterterrorist Golden Division, fled from Ramadi, allowing the city fall to a numerically modest contingent of ISIS jihadists. Having been initially instructed by Iraq\\'s Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to refrain from defending the city (no doubt at the prompting of Washington) the Hashd al-Shaabi, the umbrella organization for these Shia militias, now say they are prepping a massive counteroffensive to retake Ramadi. It promises to be a drawn-out and highly fraught counteroffensive, pitting paramilitaries—which have been accused of war crimes and atrocities by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights—against genocidal ISIS militants.\\n\\nMany Iraqis fear, with good reason, that this counteroffensive will also extend to Sunni civilians who will now be branded \"collaborators\" of ISIS, as they have in previous Hashd-led operations. The result: torture, extrajudicial killing, and ethnic cleansing. Nothing would better serve the ISIS narrative or legitimate its claim to be the last custodian and safeguard of Sunni Muslims in the Middle East. Such an outcome might even precede the eventual disintegration of the modern state of Iraq into warring ethno-religious enclaves. That this was ISIS\\'s plan all along adds yet another grim paragraph to the obituary of American-hatched adventurism in the Middle East.\\n\\nTrue, Hashd al-Shaabi has routed ISIS elsewhere before, namely in Amerli and Jurf al-Sakhar and Tikrit. In the aftermath, the militia was accused of committing human rights abuses, but those accusations didn\\'t tear the country apart.\\n\\nThe difference with Ramadi, however, is one of both scale and symbolism. This city of close to 200,000 is dead center in the Sunni heartland of Iraq, where ISIS has the home advantage. Ramadi was also, not coincidentally, the cynosure of the so-called \"Anbar Awakening,\" which saw hundreds of thousands of Sunni tribesmen rise up against ISIS\\'s predecessor, al-Qaeda in Iraq, in a cautious but fruitful partnership with American soldiers in the mid-2000s, a grassroots counterinsurgency whose gains were then solidified by the \"surge\" orchestrated by U.S. commander General David Petraeus. This time, absent any American combat forces, there are Shia Islamists who have never before tread into Ramadi. Many Iraqis dread the consequences.\\n\\n\"Iraq is not unified,\" Iraq\\'s former Deputy Prime Minister Rafe Essawi, a senior Sunni political leader originally from Anbar, told The Daily Beast. \"Fifty percent of the country belongs either to Kurds or ISIS, and 50 percent belongs'}, {'id': 255023, 'ended': True, 'length': 243, 'text': 'The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reinforced what private-sector economists have been saying for months: The best proposals to spur the economy would cost the government but prove better at quickly creating jobs than pursuing an anti-regulatory policy as proposed Republicans in Congress.\\n\\nCBO Director Douglas Elmendorf said extending unemployment benefits or payroll tax breaks to those who are most likely to spend the money, as well as providing as tax credits to companies that hire new workers, are among the types of policies that could best boost the economy and create jobs.

Here is the backstory.\\n\\nOne of the reasons repeatedly stated by President George W. Bush for the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 was the maintenance of \"torture rooms\" by Saddam Hussein. While making this very argument, Bush was secretly authorizing CIA agents to engage in similar unlawful behavior for similar purposes: intelligence and deterrence. Bush sounded credible when he claimed that his administration adhered to federal and international legal standards.\\n\\nHe knew he could make that claim because the torturers were sworn to secrecy, as were their congressional regulators. The CIA charter permits Congress to regulate the CIA in secret. Congress has established two secret congressional committees, one from the Senate and one from the House, to serve as monitors and regulators of CIA activities. The stated reason for the secrecy is to keep our enemies from knowing what the CIA is doing. The effect of the secrecy has been a muzzled Congress, lied to by law-breaking and rogue CIA officials.\\n\\nUntil now.\\n\\nWhen the Senate Intelligence Committee staff learned of the destroyed videotapes (a federal crime the Justice Department declined to prosecute) and reported that destruction to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the committee chair, she ordered an investigation to determine whether the CIA officials who had briefed her committee had told the truth. If they had been truthful, she reasoned, why destroy the tapes? In order to conduct that investigation, Feinstein ordered the CIA to make available to her committee\\'s investigators whatever documents and digital data the investigators sought.\\n\\nDuring the course of the investigation, Senate investigators suspected their computers had been hacked. When they brought those suspicions to Feinstein, she ordered another investigation, this one aimed at identifying the hackers. That investigation revealed that the CIA itself was spying on its own Senate investigators. When she approached CIA Director John Brennan about this, he denied it. When she went to the floor of the Senate—where her vow of secrecy may lawfully be disregarded—to reveal that the CIA had spied on her and her fellow Senators and their investigators, the CIA denied it. When she released incontrovertible evidence of CIA domestic spying, Brennan admitted that his agents had spied on their regulators (another federal crime the feds declined to prosecute), but claimed it was needed because the regulators had exceeded their authority in examining CIA documents.\\n\\nAll this put the original investigation of why the tapes of the torture had been destroyed and whether the CIA had been truthful to the White House and its congressional regulators into high gear. When the investigators\\' final report—all 6,000 pages of it, much in lurid detail—was completed, it was sent to the White House, which decided to release it. The CIA begged for redactions of agents\\' names and other identifiers, and a long process of negotiation ensued between the White House, the State Department, the CIA, and the Senate. This week, Feinstein had had enough and decided to release the report with the then-agreed-upon redactions.\\n\\nThe report is damning in the extreme to the Bush administration and to the CIA leadership. It offers proof that the CIA engaged in physical and psychological torture, some of which was authorized—unlawfully, yet authorized—and most of which was not. The report also demonstrates that CIA officials repeatedly lied to the White House and to Senate regulators about what they were doing, and they lied about the effectiveness of their torture.\\n\\nIf the allegations in the report are true, we have war criminals, perjurers, computer hackers and thugs on the government payroll. We also have dupes. The most politically successful argument the torture lobby has made is that we are all safer because of these dirty deeds. This Senate report refutes that argument by demonstrating that no serious actionable intelligence came from the torture.\\n\\nAll torture is criminal under all circumstances—under treaties to which the U.S. is a party, under the Constitution that governs the government wherever it goes, and under federal law. Torture degrades the victim and the perpetrator. It undermines the moral authority of a country whose government condones it. It destroys the rule of law. It exposes our own folks to the awful retaliatory beheadings we have all seen. It is slow, inefficient, morbid, and ineffective. It is a recruiting tool for those who have come to cause us harm. All human beings possess basic inalienable rights derived from the natural law and protected by the Constitution the CIA has sworn to uphold. Torture violates all of those rights.\\n\\nWhat should we make of this report on government torture?

But in order to gather the necessary information you need on a hike, a quality laser rangefinder can help you figure out the distance to your next location. This not only provides climbers with an understanding of distances, but it also helps to increase safety by providing accurate and reliable information from which climbers can use to make important decisions, especially on more dangerous and technical routes.\\n\\nAnother great feature of laser rangefinders are their compatibility. When you're out climbing mountains, the last thing you need is more stuff weighing you down. A majority of laser rangefinders are designed to fit inside your bag with no problem. Depending on your preference, rangefinders for mountaineering can also be handheld or come with a tripod for added stability.\\n\\nHunting is all about precision and accuracy. Make any small mistake and that opportunity you had can disappear in seconds. That is why hunters strive to remove all of the unpredictable or unknown variables that they can, ensuring the best chance of making the shot. That is why rangefinders are becoming more in more popular in the hunting world. Rangefinders can provide hunters with the exact distances between them and their targets.\\n\\nThis takes a lot of guesswork and estimating out of the equation which highly increases the chances of a successful shot. There are rangefinders that can be found designed for the sole purpose of hunting. Some models are designed for hand-held usage, while others include mounts or poles. Still, some other models mount directly onto your hunting weapon of choice, whether that be a bow, rifle and more.\\n\\nSome of the major manufacturers of laser rangefinders include Bushnell, Luepold, hunting giant Cabela, and even some camera manufacturers such as Nikon and Canon produce their own quality laser rangefinders. Depending on the laser rangefinder itself and the manufacturer, their specificity of use may differ. For those wanting to use a rangefinder for only hunting, it would be wise to purchase one from a company who specializes in this field. The same goes for those looking for laser rangefinders for the sole purpose of mountaineering. In effect, all laser rangefinders accomplish the same task, but some added features can specialize it to the user's particular needs.\\n\\nWhether you are climbing a mountain or heading out for a weekend of hunting, guessing distances won't help you succeed. Take away all of the doubts and guessing by utilizing a laser rangefinder. The sheer accuracy of these tools will make sure that all of the unknown variables are removed. If you're climbing a mountain, you no longer have to worry if your estimates are correct.

With Reflector Mage you get another bounce while dodging. Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit gives you more counters on top of more counters. While you may not always want Flux, it's such a flexible card that really holds the deck together.\\n\\nOjutai's Command: I consider this a resiliency play - The average use I see is bringing Rattlechains back and drawing a card, although countering a big creature and drawing/bringing Rattlechains back is a decent one too. I haven't tested this too much, but it seems to do a lot to fix the biggest problem with this deck - losing Rattlechains before it can be replaced.\\n\\nAny feedback and criticism especially is welcome, wanted and encouraged! I've previously played both control and aggro, but tempo is a new thing for me. I feel this concept might give me something to practice as this playstyle seems fairly powerful once it's mastered.\"}, {'id': 255031, 'ended': True, 'length': 60, 'text': 'About \"List of WWE/WWF Finishers\"\\n\\nThis is a comprehensive list of (almost!) every finishing move in the WWE and WWF.

There are of course many ways to purge, sort, and organize fabric, which I\\'ll write about later. But first, I wanted to address questions about the folding station and the folding method we used.\\n\\nIt\\'s the same method I\\'ve been using as I\\'ve been sorting and organizing fabric in my own apartment. Here you see an in-progress picture of my new studio corner with stacks of uniformly-folded fabric. This is a method I first read about from Monica, the Happy Zombie and later from Marilyn Bohn\\'s video.\\n\\nOf course there are other ways, but this is the cheap, easy, quick one that works for me. The goal is to end up with a stack of fabric that is uniformly folded — the same length and width.\\n\\nThe height of each folded piece varies according to how much yardage you have to begin with.\\n\\nTo accomplish this, you\\'ll need a stack of fabric (45″ wide works best, though other widths can be accommodated), a flat surface, and a large quilter\\'s ruler. My mom had three 6.5″-wide rulers, so we defaulted to using those for her project. However, the cubbies on my shelf are 13″ wide. In order to comfortably fit 2 stacks of fabric side-to-side, I needed to use a slightly smaller ruler. Mine is 6″ wide and 24″ long.\\n\\nI don\\'t currently have any fabric that hasn\\'t been folded by this method, so I had to un-fold a piece to show you how it\\'s done. Pardon the creases!\\n\\nFirst, ensure that the fabric is folded in half lengthwise (selvedge-to-selvedge) with the wrong sides together. Many fabrics (including most quilter\\'s cotton) are approximately 45″ wide, which leaves you with a span of fabric around 22″ after it\\'s folded in half. For my ruler of 24″, this is just perfect. It leaves a little bit of ruler poking out on either end.\\n\\nBegin \"wrapping\" the fabric around the ruler, starting with the raw edge nearest to you. It\\'s almost like you\\'re making a small \"bolt\" of fabric with the quilter\\'s ruler where the cardboard core would be.\\n\\nContinue wrapping (flipping the ruler away from you) until you reach the other raw edge of the fabric. At this point, you have two options.\\n\\nIf the remaining edge is wide enough, you can just fold it over. However, if that edge piece is too small and won\\'t lie flat, there is another option.\\n\\nIf the last wrapped edge is too small to lie flat, unfold the bolt of fabric and tuck the edge under. Then, flip the bolt on top of the fold and it will seal the edge up into the wraps of fabric.\\n\\nPull the ruler out from the center of the fabric. Make sure that it lies flat and the raw edge doesn\\'t pop out.\\n\\nFold the fabric in half cross-wise. (Hamburger fold, not hotdog.)\\n\\nPlace your folded fabric on the shelf with the folded edge facing you. that way, you can see at a glance what colors of fabric you\\'ve got.\\n\\nYou can see that the finished piece is a little larger than 6″ wide, and about 11″ long. This will vary depending on your ruler, so make sure you understand your shelves or storage spaces before you have to unfold your whole collection!\\n\\nA lot of people store their fat quarters separate from the rest of their fabric collection. My mom wanted hers kept separate, so we did what Monica Zombie suggested and folded the fat quarters in the same way but with a smaller ruler. I prefer to keep my fabric all together, since I\\'m generally hunting for fabric of a certain color, rather than of a certain size.\\n\\nA fat quarter is generally around 18″ x 22″. Using my 6″ ruler allows me to make a tidy little bolt and store all of my fabric in one place.\\n\\nFold one edge in…\\n\\nThen the other.\\n\\nJust as before, remove the ruler and fold in half.\\n\\nVoila! If you\\'re starting with 60″ fabric, vintage sheets, or other odd-sized pieces, the procedure is the same. All you have to do is fold it lengthwise (hotdog, not hamburger) to approximately 20-24″ wide before you begin wrapping. For a 60″ piece, I generally just fold it in thirds lengthwise and it pretty much evens out in the end.\\n\\nBe aware that extra yardage (3+ yards) will yield pieces that are noticeably wider due to the sheer bulk of fabric as you wrap around and around. You may need to take this into account as you plan out the size of your storage system'}, {'id': 255034, 'ended': True, 'length': 323, 'text': 'The pace of the race to the top of Fortune\\'s Unicorn List continues to hasten as startups raise ever-larger sums of money to fuel growth and expansion.\\n\\nAirbnb, the well-known home rental service headquartered in San Francisco, has closed a new $1.5 billion funding round, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times.

Jason Brezler received support and endorsements from congressmen, a former assistant secretary of defense, and even Marine Corps generals at his board of inquiry, a panel of three officers recommended Thursday that he be separated from the Marine Corps with an honorable discharge.\\n\\nAfter three days of testimony and arguments and more than two hours of deliberation, the board, composed of Col. James Iulo, Col. Bart Pester and Lt. Col. Todd Manyx, found that Brezler, a Reserve officer and New York City firefighter, had demonstrated substandard conduct, misconduct or professional or moral dereliction, and conduct unbecoming an officer by failing to observe correct protocols for handling classified information. He doesn\\'t deserve to stay in the Corps, they concluded.\\n\\nBrezler came under investigation in 2012 when he received an urgent email from then-Capt. Andrew Terrell regarding Sarwar Jan, a corrupt Afghan police chief with known Taliban ties and a penchant for child sex abuse who had gained access to a Marine base. Brezler, attending a graduate school seminar in Oklahoma at the time, fired off a classified briefing document about Jan from his Yahoo account.\\n\\nWhen another officer who received the email raised the alarm about sending the document over a nonsecure network, Brezler reported himself to his superiors and cooperated with a Naval Criminal Investigative Service probe into the classified material spillage. The probe turned up another folder with some 106 documents marked secret. Brezler said he inadvertently brought them back with him following his 2010 deployment to Now Zad, Afghanistan, where limited resources sometimes meant Marines worked on their personal computers and thumb drives.\\n\\nSeventeen days after Brezler sent the document about Sarwar Jan, one of the teenage boys whom Jan kept on base grabbed a rifle and killed three Marines, seriously wounding another.\\n\\nTestifying in his own defense Thursday morning, Bezler said his response \"was just visceral\" when he received the email regarding Jan. \"His name brought me great concern, knowing he was somewhere in the battlespace. I immediately responded.\"\\n\\nWhen he learned about the deaths of the three Marines, he felt that his worst fears had come true, Brezler said.\\n\\nBut a Marine prosecutor said this week that the case was about more than that one communication with Marines in Afghanistan. Brezler knowingly kept classified documents to inform a book he was writing about his Now Zad experiences, said Maj. Chip Hodge, showing that Brezler had copied and pasted a paragraph from the Sarwar Jan document into his manuscript, \"Rebirth of Apocalypse Now Zad.\"\\n\\nBrezler was feigning ignorance by saying he had taken the documents home by mistake and that he used the Sarwar Jan information in his manuscript without realizing it was classified, Hodge said.\\n\\n\"He knew [the classified information] was there. He knew he had access to it. He knew where to go for it,\" said Hodge. \"... [Brezler] didn\\'t think the rules applied to him.\"\\n\\nBrezler\\'s defenders are many. His attorneys, Maj. Amelia Kays and Kevin Carroll, submitted 60 letters of recommendation to the board, which included praise from Marine generals. On Wednesday, nine witnesses testified in his defense, including three of his commanding officers and bestselling author Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense.\\n\\nFirst Marine Division commander Maj. Gen. Lawrence Nicholson, commander of the 1st Marine Division, wrote that Brezler\\'s contributions in Iraq and Afghanistan \"rank among the most important I\\'ve seen in the most challenging settings.\"\\n\\nJohn Kael Weston, a former State Department official who has advised Marine generals in Iraq and who met Brezler in Now Zad, said his separation would be a loss for the country.\\n\\n\"We need a bench of experienced officers so our nation is prepared the next time we need a Marine Corps,\" he said. With Brezler\\'s separation, he said, \"The Marine Corps loses, he obviously loses, but we as a nation lose.\"\\n\\nThe case has also received a flurry of press attention from media outlets nationally and in Brezler\\'s home state of New York, with many asking why Brezler was investigated so aggressively after trying to inform fellow Marines about a perceived threat.\\n\\nIn his closing argument, Hodge pulled up a Google page showing all the news search results under Brezler\\'s name, suggesting the media coverage following the case should play into the board\\'s deliberation.\\n\\n\"There are likely millions of people around the country waiting for your decision,\" he said. \"Do we want good military character to trump military actions?\"\\n\\nBrezler also has been defended by Sen.'}, {'id': 255036, 'ended': True, 'length': 450, 'text': 'Women across Denmark have complained of harassment by migrants who they accused of making them feel unsafe when out at night.\\n\\nIn the town of Thisted in the north of the country, authorities admitted there was a harassment \"problem\" stemming from migrants based at the local asylum centre which opened in November.\\n\\nLars Sloth of the town\\'s children and families unit said: \"Several young women have felt unsafe on the streets, where they have been accosted by asylum seekers.

I don't think they're foolish enough to engage and torture a 21-year-old boy who just stole a political banner. Yeah, he's a bargaining chip, but there's no reason why he might have been tortured.\\n\\nBut with the North Koreans in the past, you could get prisoners out in exchange for high-level visits, humanitarian assistance.

If she had a good marriage and he died, there might be wiggle room, but I still wouldn\\'t date her).\\n\\n1: She decided to have a kid without a husband. This demonstrates terrible, selfish values.

Getting branded with a big \"M\" on your forehead (For Molester) will WRECK YOUR LIFE. It will never go away. Too big a risk.\\n\\n4: Relationship aren\\'t easy as it is. Add a minor child and it really complicates the issue. Do you want to deal with her kid(s) too? You won\\'t be their dad and they will know it. Their mom already fucked up their life by not having a dad for them, and is fucking it up more by bringing in \"Revolving door boyfriends\" into their life.\\n\\n5: Lots of single moms have financial problems. You will be obligated to help pay for sitters, food, braces, on and on. For children that aren\\'t yours. Get the credit card out!\\n\\n6: There is NO reason to date one. Millions of women in this country are single with no kids, and in every age range. Go younger if you have to. Don\\'t waste your time with a woman that has PROVEN that she doesn\\'t want a husband for her and dad for her kids. Do you think she will change her mind for you? That she will forget her utter contempt for husbands and fathers just for you? Sure she will.\\n\\nI run into single mothers once in a while, and when \"I have a kid\" is revealed, that\\'s the end of the conversation for me.

The video, featuring muscled men alongside Jenek in and out of drag, presents a binary between what is expected of male beauty and feminine beauty, a conflict that Jenek has been wrestling with much of his young adult life.\\n\\n\"I struggled with my own masculinity, [and] even struggled with my own gender identity over the years,\" the RuPaul\\'s Drag Race finalist confesses to The Advocate the day after Bianca Del Rio was crowned the season 6 champion. \"I felt really torn between my passion, which was doing drag, and wanting to have the right body and have the right look so I could be found sexually desirable.\"\\n\\nGender identity is a topic that Jenek discusses a lot, particularly in light of this season of RuPaul\\'s Drag Race, in which the overlapping waters of the drag and transgender communities heated to a boil. This battle has largely been over the authority of the right to use words like \"tranny\" or \"shemale,\" which many trans activists consider slurs and some drag performers defend as endemic to drag pride and culture. As a result of this battle, Drag Race\\'s network, Logo TV, not only apologized and pulled a controversial episode from its archives — in which contestants had to label close-up photographs as either \"female\" or \"shemale\" — but it also went a step further, vowing to remove a popular segment, \"You\\'ve Got Shemail,\" which was present from the show\\'s inception, from all future seasons.\\n\\nThis act sparked even further resentment and eye-rolling among many past Drag Race fans and cast members. One of them, season 6 champion Bianca Del Rio, told The Advocate, \"It\\'s not that serious. It\\'s a drag show on Logo. We dress up. We pretend we\\'re puppets. … Lighten the fuck up.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m a Libra, so I see this from both sides,\" added Adore Delano, a Drag Race season 6 finalist alongside Del Rio and Act. \"In high school, I identified as transgender for years, so I personally find it interesting that it took [the transgender community] six years to get offended by that. But, I also see where they\\'re coming from. I think BenDeLaCreme actually said this brilliantly. She said, \\'There\\'s so many words in the vocabulary. And if there\\'s one word that you\\'re using that could possibly offend someone, and really offend somebody, than why not just completely wipe it from your vocabulary and use something else.\\' I get that, but it\\'s like, I see it from both ways. The show is so trans-friendly and so fun, and so campy, that it\\'s like, there\\'s no way you can take that out of context.\"\\n\\nFor Jenek, the debate also hits on issues close to home. His drag performance as Courtney Act, which so dazzled the Drag Race judges, had another effect on some fans in the past, who tried to convince Jenek that his convincing portrayal of a female meant that he must be a transgender woman. Jenek wasn\\'t sure what to think. He remembers bursting into tears one night at the home of a friend because of his conflicted feelings about his gender identity.\\n\\n\"I was tormented, because I didn\\'t know if I wanted to be a woman or if I wanted to be a man,\" he recalls.\\n\\nAs a result, the native Australian performer, who first rose to fame as a singer on Australian Idol only after slipping into Courtney Act\\'s sequined gown, grew to resent his female persona. He would eschew weightlifting at the gym because he did not want to \"look too bulky for Courtney, and kind of blaming Courtney because of that.\"\\n\\nToday, Jenek no longer feels divided about his gender identity and has come to embrace both masculine and feminine sides. While he now identifies as a gay male, he views gender identity as more of a spectrum, in which he falls \"closer to the middle than most.\"\\n\\n\"The majority of people fall in the spectrum. And I think gender is like that as well,\" he says. \"I think we are born a certain sex, but we all express our gender in ways that is transgender.\"\\n\\nHis experiences have led him to seek out more information, sitting down with trans musician Our Lady J to talk about the issue on YouTube. Ultimately, he concluded that the problem wasn\\'t that the topic wasn\\'t serious, but rather, that the conversation between the drag and transgender community was stuck in place.\\n\\n\"I felt there was a lot of \\'we\\'re right, you\\'re wrong,\\' pushing back and forth, different sides of the argument.

A 1973 legislative report on child care in the state said members heard testimony from children previously in Roloff\\'s Rebekah Home for Girls about irregular meals and whippings. Roloff told lawmakers his homes should be exempted from state interference due to his religious roots.\\n\\n\"We spanked them because God loves them, and we love them,\" Roloff told the committee.\\n\\nThose hearings led to the Legislature passing Senate Bill 965 in 1975, which established child care licensing laws in the state.\\n\\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\\n\\nNow, 42 years later, Texas legislators are considering sharpening religious protections for faith-based groups the state hires to place children in foster and adoptive homes and oversee their care. Critics say this could give religious groups license to use their faith as a reason to refuse to place foster children with gay couples or with families with certain religious beliefs. Legislators say this could halt bipartisan warmth on bills changing how Texas cares for abused and neglected children.\\n\\nRep. James Frank, R-Wichita Falls, vice chairman of the House Human Services Committee, has authored House Bill 3859, which would protect faith-based providers from retaliation if they assert their \"sincerely held religious beliefs\" while caring for abused and neglected children.\\n\\nThe bill would include allowing faith-based groups to deny a placement if it\\'s against their religious beliefs; place a child in a religion-based school; deny referrals for abortion-related contraceptives, drugs or devices; and refuse to contract with other organizations that go against their religious beliefs.\\n\\n\\nFrank said the his bill is meant to give \"reasonable accommodations\" for faith-based groups and not meant to be exclusionary. He said the ultimate goal is to help find the right home for kids.\\n\\nFaith-based organizations are closing their doors to foster children \"because they can\\'t afford to stay in business when they\\'re getting sued on stuff,\" Frank said. \"They\\'re basically being told to conform or get out on stuff that\\'s important but it\\'s not core to taking care of foster homes.\"\\n\\nThe potential religious liberty fight comes as Texas legislators try to reimagine how to care for vulnerable children and entice more communities to open their homes to them. Part of that strategy includes convincing more faith communities to partner with the state. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick hosted a Faith Leader Summit in November encouraging congregations to help, and Texas First Lady Cecilia Abbott in January publicly urged religious groups to support foster families with donations and other activities.\\n\\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors.

Allmon said some of the 13 such groups in Texas have faced lawsuits for not taking a young woman to get an abortion or not putting children in gay and lesbian households. For now, she said, the legislation\\'s fate would be a \"critical factor\" in how Catholic Charities decides to move forward with the state.\\n\\n\"It\\'s about recognizing the role of the faith-based provider and not extending beyond our role,\" Allmon said. \"We\\'re asked to come forward and serve in this system because of our faith and our values and our mission.\"\\n\\nShe pointed out that Catholic charities in California, the District of Columbia, Illinois and Massachusetts closed their foster care services when lawmakers did not pass religious protections for them. Right now, some of the groups in Texas have suspended services temporarily to see what the Legislature does about added protections.\\n\\nChuck Smith, CEO of Equality Texas, an LGBT rights group, said he was scared of HB 3859 after watching similar legislation become law in Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota and Virginia. He said Frank\\'s bill allows the possibility of children being denied services because of what a provider believes and that would not fly if it were any other state contractor.\\n\\n\"Any piece of legislation that would allow the personal or religious beliefs of a provider to override the best interest of the child is misplaced and I would suggest is a gross change in what religious liberty actually means,\" Smith said.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear if HB 3859 will make it to the House floor, but there are rumblings among legislators that it could be tacked onto another child welfare measure, House Bill 6, as an amendment. That bill, also by Frank, would overhaul the child welfare system by allowing more contracted organizations to monitor children in foster care.\\n\\nRep.

Zoro grimaces in pain from a hit he took, as he rises to his feet. Ohm berates him for being a blue sea dweller that knows nothing, as he explains that his blade is actually the result of an iron cloud dial built into the hilt of the sword. It allows the blade to follow its target anywhere, which he then demonstrates by extending it all the way to Zoro from several meters away. Zoro blocks the attack with ease, commenting on the whip-like nature of the sword and how the warriors of the White Cloud Seas are like a bunch of circus performers.\\n\\nSensing new arrivals to the battlefield, Ohm tells Holy that they will now be splitting up. As predicted, both Shandia and God\\'s Army Enforcers soon join them on the battlefield.

But what\\'s less often considered is how these changes could also impact social mobility. A new report from UK charity Sutton Trust explains the danger, noting that unless governments take action, the next wave of automation will dramatically increase inequality within societies, further entrenching the divide between rich and poor.\\n\\nThe are a number of reasons for this, say the report\\'s authors, including the ability of richer individuals to re-train for new jobs; the rising importance of \"soft skills\" like communication and confidence; and the reduction in the number of jobs used as \"stepping stones\" into professional industries.\\n\\n\"Traditionally, jobs like these have been a vehicle for social mobility.\"\\n\\nFor example, the demand for paralegals and similar professions is likely to be reduced over the coming years as artificial intelligence is trained to handle more administrative tasks. In the UK more than 350,000 paralegals, payroll managers, and bookkeepers could lose their jobs if automated systems can do the same work.\\n\\n\"Traditionally, jobs like these have been a vehicle for social mobility,\" Sutton Trust research manager Carl Cullinane tells The Verge. Cullinane says that for individuals who weren\\'t able to attend university or get particular qualifications, semi-administrative jobs are often a way in to professional industries. \"But because they don\\'t require more advanced skills they\\'re likely to be vulnerable to automation,\" he says.\\n\\nSimilarly, as automation reduces the need for administrative skills, other attributes will become more sought after in the workplace. These include so-called \"soft skills\" like confidence, motivation, communication, and resilience. \"It\\'s long established that private schools put a lot of effort into making sure their pupils have those sorts of skills,\" says Cullinane. \"And these will become even more important in a crowded labor market.\"\\n\\nRe-training for new jobs will also become a crucial skill, and it\\'s individuals from wealthier backgrounds that are more able to do so, says the report. This can already be seen in the disparity in terms of post-graduate education, with individuals in the UK with working class or poorer backgrounds far less likely to re-train after university.\\n\\nThe report, which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group and published this Wednesday, looks specifically at the UK, where it says some 15 million jobs are at risk of automation. But the Sutton Trust says its findings are also relevant to other developed nations, particularly the US, where social mobility is a major problem.\\n\\nSocial mobility is already a big problem in America\\n\\nOne study in 2016 found that America has become significantly less conducive to social mobility over the past few decades. \"It is increasingly the case that no matter what your educational background is, where you start has become increasingly important for where you end,\" one of the study\\'s authors, Michael D. Carr, told The Atlantic last year. Another report found that around half of 30-year-olds in the US earn less than their parents at the same age, compared to the 1970s, when almost 90 percent earned more.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note, though, that there is disagreement about how bad the impact of automation on the job market will be. Some reports have suggested that up to 50 percent of jobs in developed countries are at risk, while others point out that only specific tasks will be automated — rather than whole professions. Economists also note that new categories of jobs are likely to be created, although exactly what, and how many, is impossible to accurately predict.\\n\\nThe Sutton Trust report also says that there is some reason to be optimistic about the coming wave of automation, particularly if governments can encourage people to train for STEM professions (those involving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).\\n\\n\"From a social mobility perspective there are two important things about the STEM sector,\" says Cullinane of the UK job market. \"Firstly, there doesn\\'t seem to be a substantial gap in the income background of people taking STEM related subjects, and secondly, there isn\\'t a resulting pay gap for those who come from different backgrounds.

It\\'s a lot easier, cheaper, and faster, however, to redesign a drone than an entire airplane. \"The idea is to have a tech refresh fielded in months instead of years,\" says Reid Melville, strategy lead for unmanned systems at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. \"That way, when we get surprised, we will have the infrastructure in place to make a rapid change.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\nExcept when it comes to singing The Righteous Brothers songs in bars, this new generation of drones promises to be the perfect wingman. They make no mistakes and have no emotion. And if the situation demands it, they are willing sacrifices. There is one big difference, however: Like soldiers, drones will always deserve gratitude. Unlike soldiers, however, they\\'ll never deserve a funeral.\\n\\nThe Arsenal\\n\\nSeven of the most promising designs right now.\\n\\nMiniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD)\\n\\n•MALD is a trailblazer. In the mid-1990s DARPA started researching this small jet-engine-powered craft, fired from a warplane\\'s wing, that could fly along GPS waypoints and emit signals to mimic a full-size aircraft. Hidden air-defense systems shoot at MALD and expose themselves to counterattack. After a stutter-step start, the technology caught up with the idea and in 2009 Raytheon delivered the first MALD to the Air Force. Recent upgrades include a carbon-composite fuselage that lightens the airframe. An upcoming datalink ability will enable pilots to reprogram MALD\\'s flight path after launch.\\n\\n•Status: Currently deployed.\\n\\nRyan Inzana\\n\\nCoyote\\n\\n•Dropped from an airplane, these disposable drones are launched from a six-inch tube and unfold in flight. They are currently launched from National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration airplanes to study hurricanes. The Air Force special-ops folks have converted them for use on gunships, to aim at targets obscured by clouds.\\n\\n•Status: Currently deployed.\\n\\nAir-Launched, Tube-Integrated, Unmanned System (ALTIUS)\\n\\nDrones such as the Coyote can stay airborne for only an hour. The USAF tactical off-board sensing program wants a drone that can provide continuous surveillance coverage for at least four. So they came up with ALTIUS. It has a state-of-the-art, high-energy-density power system that can withstand harsh environmental conditions, does not pose an explosive hazard, and can be stored for more than six months. It uses a highly efficient, lightweight carbon-composite airframe, and its slender shape is designed to fit in a six- to eight-inch launch tube.\\n\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\n•Status: In development.

But they both went offline by September 2013, making Japan completely nuclear-free for about two years.\\n\\nThe country has ushered in stricter safety regulations to avoid a repeat of the accident, including more backup prevention measures and higher tsunami-blocking walls in some areas.\\n\\n\"It is important to restart reactors one by one from the perspective of energy security, the economy and measures against global warming, but safety always comes first,\" Industry Minister Yoichi Miyazawa told reporters.\\n\\nIf another atomic accident happened, he added, the government would \"deal with it responsibly\".\\n\\nBeefed-up safety measures are key to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\\'s bid to get some of about four dozen reactors back up and running, as Tokyo\\'s energy policy sets its sights on nuclear accounting for as much as 22 percent of Japan\\'s energy needs by 2030.\\n\\nPower companies that own them are also keen for more restarts, fed up with having to make up lost generating capacity with pricey fossil fuels.\\n\\nJapan\\'s post-Fukushima energy bill skyrocketed as it scrambled to fill the gap left by taking reactors offline, pushing the country into successive trade deficits.\\n\\nThose expenses were exacerbated by a sharp weakening of the yen, which pushed up costs for energy imports paid for in other currencies, particularly the US dollar.\\n\\nSeveral other reactors have received a safety green light from officials, but battle lines have been drawn with many local communities strongly opposed to restarts.\\n\\nTakashi Kato, professor emeritus at Tokyo\\'s Seikei University, was critical of Tuesday\\'s restart, saying Abe\\'s close business ties were trumping safety concerns.\\n\\n\"Abe is not listening to the voice of the people -- he is acting as if he has been given a blank cheque,\" Kato said.\\n\\n\"It is big business demanding a stable supply of power by resuming nuclear reactors, not the general public.\"\\n\\nSafety officials have stressed that any switched-on reactor would operate under much tighter regulations than those that existed before Fukushima, the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.\\n\\n\"A disaster like that at Tokyo Electric Power\\'s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant will not occur,\" under the new rules, Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) chairman Shunichi Tanaka said in an interview with the Nikkei newspaper published at the weekend.\\n\\nBut Tanaka conceded there was \"no such thing as absolute safety\", and Japan\\'s people are sceptical as the country remains deeply scarred by the legacy of Fukushima.\\n\\nShort link:'}, {'id': 255057, 'ended': False, 'length': 1024, 'text': 'In a country where racial classifications create social hierarchies that assert the superiority of white skin and Caucasian features, and the inferiority of \"black\" skin and Asian features, interracial and interethnic couples in Lebanon are abhorred, stigmatized and socially ostracised.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a stranger in my own country,\" Saeb Kayali, a Thai-Lebanese, told Al-Akhbar.\\n\\n\"Demeaning gestures, head-shaking, stares, and under-the-breath comments are the most passive of the reactions we get in public,\" \"I remember once a woman asked my friend, who happened to be right next to me, if I spoke Arabic,\" Kayali said, \"And I always get questions like \\'Where are you from?

This is still true, as Kennen can very easily scale thanks to the lack of kill pressure that tanks generally have.\\n\\nWith the new midseason patch and attempt to shift kill pressure away from tanks once more, Kennen has continued to be a staple pick in the top lane against top lane champions just hoping to get out of the lane phase without a huge disadvantage. Kennen is a great bully and an even better scaling champion, letting his splitpush plan come to fruition and carry the game alone, if given enough room.\\n\\nRunes\\n\\n1 Attack Speed and 8 Attack Damage Reds, Armor Yellows, 3 Attack Speed and 6 Magic Resistance Blues, Attack Speed Quintessences\\n\\nThis rune page gives you a good balance of resistances, attack damage, and attack speed. Because of Kennen\\'s W passive, he\\'s more inclined to specialize in attack speed earlier, and more attack speed increases his sustain through Doran\\'s Blade as well as his initial Blade of the Ruined King buy, making his dueling much better in the early and mid game stages.\\n\\nMasteries\\n\\nEighteen in Ferocity is pretty standard for auto attacking threats. Kennen has great synergy with Fervor of battle in particular, as the attack damage contributes to his W passive, which will give him greater burst damage as he builds up the empowered auto attack. Fresh Blood and Battle Trance help with laning without a downside, and Kennen needs the armor penetration over the magic penetration for his Blade of the Ruined King damage onto tanks despite his tendency to do slightly more magic damage (thanks to creeps having low magic resistance) over the course of the game.\\n\\nTwelve in Resolve keeps Kennen alive and allows him to threaten the splitpush much more often thanks to the use of Insight. Insight should be taken over Fearless because Kennen already gets a good chunk of resistances in fights through his E, making more resistance suboptimal versus having health to balance it out. As well, having Flash and Teleport up more often allows Kennen to make cross-map plays and use the utility of flash to escape sticky splitpush or teamfight situations. Veteran Scars and Tough Skin help optimize his early resistances and contributes to a brutal laning phase for the opponent as trading becomes more and more fruitless.\\n\\nSkill Order\\n\\nFirst six levels: QEWWWR\\n\\nGetting Q first is the best harass tool, and E afterwards helps escape any early cheese from the top laner or jungler. After, however, W is the skill you want to max. It helps with waveclear in conjunction with E, and actually scales with your total attack damage, increasing by level. This is AD Kennen\\'s primary tool for dueling as it provides huge burst in lane in combination with an active W.\\n\\nAfter that, maxing E second helps with waveclear and gives you access to your escape much more often, making your splitpush a lot safer. Your ultimate should be leveled when possible, and your Q should be leveled last despite its early point as a harass tool.\\n\\nBuild Order\\n\\nThough Doran\\'s Shield got a huge buff, it\\'s still not a great choice for champions hoping to bully their lane as Kennen would. Rushing Blade of the Ruined King is a must, even though it got its cost very very slightly increased. After that, going Frozen Mallet will ensure that you will have the survivability and kiting ability to deal with any tank or fighter hoping to contest your presence in a side lane. Phantom Dancer adds to your attack speed and continues to help your survivability for a very low cost. Death\\'s Dance got an insane buff in Patch 7.9 that helps Kennen\\'s dueling substantially, and contributes to his W passive more than any other AD item given it having 80 attack damage. Guardian Angel helps as well, as it also now gives attack damage.\\n\\nDoran\\'s Blade + Health Potion Blade of the Ruined King Mercury Treads Frozen Mallet Phantom Dancer Death\\'s Dance Guardian Angel Maw of Malmortius or Runaan\\'s Hurricane\\n\\nPlaystyle\\n\\nEarly game, Kennen\\'s ranged advantage lends itself well to a favorable laning phase because he can easily harass and cs simultaneously. That combined with his good base damage on abilities allows him to trade against the patterns of most meta top laners. Kennen is fairly gankable, so make sure you\\'re not pushing in. If you are, your ultimate is a good get out of jail free card as it will stun pursuers as you scurry away.

V.), where the Greek text has τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς έρημώσεως. The Greek itself, however, is referable to a Hebrew expression, , found in Dan. ix. 27 (where the ם of has been added, through a copyist\\'s error, from the מ of the ensuing word); in Dan. xi. 31, and in Dan. xii. 11 (with omission of the prefixed מ).\\n\\nThe context of these passages leaves no room for doubt as to what was intended by this somewhat odd expression; namely, the transformation, by Antiochus Epiphanes, of the sacred Temple at Jerusalem into a heathen one. In both Biblical and rabbinical Hebrew abomination is a familiar term for an idol (I Kings, xi. 5; II Kings, xxiii. 13; Sifra, Ḳedoshim, beginning, and Mekilta, Mishpatim, xx. ed. Weiss, 107), and therefore may well have the same application in Daniel, which should accordingly be rendered, in agreement with Ezra, ix. 3, 4, \"motionless abomination\" or, also, \"appalling abomination.\" The suggestion of many scholars-Hoffmann, Nestle, Bevan, and others—that , as a designation for Jupiter is simply an intentional perversion of his usual appellation \"Baal Shamem\" ( , \"lord of heaven\") is quite plausible, as is attested by the perversion of \"Beelzebub\" into \"Βεελζεβούλ\" (Greek version) in Mark, iii. 22, as well as the express injunction found in Tosef., \\'Ab. Zarah, vi. (vii) and Babli \\'Ab. Zarah, 46a, that the names of idols may be pronounced only in a distorted or abbreviated form (see the examples quoted there). Though the expression \"Abomination of Desolation\" is accordingly recognizedin the light of this interpretation as a mistranslation of the phrase used in Daniel, there is no doubt that in the circles directly influenced by the Book of Daniel—the same circles that originated the apocalyptic literature—the expression was employed to designate an important eschatological conception. For it is only in an eschatological sense that the expression can be adequately explained in the New Testament passages above mentioned.\\n\\nAccording to most modern commentators, these passages are a Jewish apocalypse, somewhat tinged with Christianity, intended to prophesy the end of time, when the Antichrist, as the Abomination of Desolation, shall be enthroned as a ruler in God\\'s Temple. The closely related \"smaller Apocalypse\" in II Thess. ii. 1-12 is a conclusive justification of this view; for it shows that neither the Romans (as Weiss in his commentary, ad loc., holds), nor the Zealots (Bleek, \"Synoptische Erklärung,\" and others), nor Caligula with his self-deification (Spitta, in his \"Offenbarung Johannis\") can be intended.\\n\\nThe rabbis as a whole consider that the expression refers to the desecration of the Temple by the erection of a Zeus statue in its sacred precincts by Antiochus Epiphanes (see Apostemos ). Some rabbis, however, see in it an allusion to Manasseh, who, as related in II Chron. xxxiii. 7, set up \"a carved image . . . in the house of God\" (Yer. Ta\\'anit, iv. 68a, and Rashi on the passage in Babli, ibid. 28b). The Haggadah narrates that two statues were erected, one of which fell over upon the other and broke off its hand. Upon the severed hand the following inscription was found engraved: \"I sought to destroy God\\'s house, but Thou didst lend Thy hand to its protection\" (Ta\\'anit, 28b et seq.; compare Rabbinovicz, \"Variæ Lectiones,\" on the passage for variant readings).\\n\\nBibliography: Compare modern commentators—Meinhold, Bevan, Weiss, Prince—upon the passages in Daniel and Matthew;\\n\\nalso Bousset, Der Antichrist, English translation, 1896, especially index;\\n\\nSpitta, Offenbarung Johannis, pp. 493-497;\\n\\nGrätz, Gesch. d.

REUTERS/Osman Orsal\\n\\nCan Dundar, editor-in-chief of the Cumhuriyet newspaper, and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul are accused of trying to topple the government with the publication last May of a video purporting to show Turkey\\'s state intelligence agency helping to ferry weapons into Syria by truck in 2014.\\n\\nTheir case has brought international condemnation and raised concerns about freedom of expression in Turkey. At their first hearing a week ago, the court took the case behind closed doors and accepted Erdogan as a complainant in what critics said was a move that undermined judicial independence.\\n\\n\"During the legal process, the president personally intervened, both as a complainant and through his repeated public statements. Turkey\\'s judicial system is not strong enough to shrug off the dominance of this president,\" Muharrem Ozay, a lawyer for the two journalists, told Reuters.\\n\\nErdogan has cast the newspaper\\'s coverage as part of an attempt to undermine Turkey\\'s global standing and has vowed that Dundar will \"pay a heavy price\".\\n\\nHe has acknowledged that the trucks, which were stopped by gendarmerie and police officers en route to the Syrian border, belonged to the MIT intelligence agency and said they were carrying aid to Turkmens in Syria. Turkmen fighters are battling both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State.\\n\\nAli Seker, one of more than a dozen opposition members of parliament outside the court room, said he and his colleagues were trying to exercise their legal right to observe the case and were concerned that Gul and Dundar might be re-arrested.\\n\\nThe court on Friday rejected the opposition applications, lawyers said. Supporters chanted \"You cannot silence the free press\" and \"Shoulder to shoulder against fascism\".\\n\\nThe two journalists spent 92 days in jail, almost half of it in solitary confinement, before the constitutional court ruled last month that pre-trial detention was unfounded because the charges stemmed from their journalism and they were released.\\n\\nErdogan said he did not respect that ruling.\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL CONCERN\\n\\nThe trial comes as Turkey tries to deflect criticism from the European Union, United States and rights groups that say it is bridling a once-vibrant press.\\n\\nThere were ugly scenes in Washington on Thursday, where Erdogan is on a visit, as his bodyguards tried to stop protesters chanting and waving banners outside the Brookings Institution think-tank where he was speaking.\\n\\n\"Turkey\\'s leader and his security team are guests in the United States,\" said Thomas Burr, president of the National Press Club. \"They have no right to lay their hands on reporters or protesters or anyone else for that matter ... Erdogan doesn\\'t get to export such abuse.\"\\n\\nIn his speech at Brookings, Erdogan warned he would continue to sue critics who insult him in Turkey, while in an interview with CNN, he denied being \"at war\" with the press.\\n\\n\"Espionage, do you think it is a freedom of expression or a freedom of press?\" he told the broadcaster.\\n\\nAhead of the trial, Dundar told Reuters he would use the hearings to refocus attention on the story that landed him in the dock, describing himself as a witness not a defendant.\\n\\nErdogan has said prosecutors had no authority to order the MIT trucks be searched and that they were part of what he calls a \"parallel state\" run by his ally-turned-foe Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Islamic cleric who the president says is bent on discrediting him and the Turkish government.\\n\\nThe prosecutors have denied those allegations, while Gulen has denied plotting against the government.'}, {'id': 255068, 'ended': True, 'length': 360, 'text': \"Has anyone else tried Competetive matches, two teams of heroes vs each other with an environment deck thrown in for fun?\\n\\nWe've been doing it (more for fun and testing than competition) for a bit and it works pretty well with only some minor changes.\\n\\nThe opposing team is counted as non-heroes and Villain targets, your team is heroes for your cards.

These large turbochargers were used to feed high-performance engines and generate significant power. The problem would come when you called upon that power. Your right foot mashes the gas—then nothing. A shock of power would eventually make its way to the drive wheels, sometimes mid-corner. Turbo lag is notoriously finicky (and in the case of old race cars, a killer) and automakers have been working on ways to reduce or eliminate it. Volvo has its own solution and it involves a bit of engineering that we need explained.\\n\\nThe system is called Power Pulse, and it works with the help of an air compressor and an electric motor. The motor waits for the driver to ask for more power, and it keeps the air compressor tank ready to go with clean air pulled in from the intake. When the throttle is pressed, the air tank can then force compressed air into the exhaust manifold and send it along with the exhaust gases to spool up the turbo.\\n\\nThis is almost similar to what the Fast and Furious crew would be doing when they hit their \"nitrous\" button. They want to force more air into the engine, and here Volvo is forcing more air into the exhaust manifold to get the turbo up to speed more quickly. There\\'s no need for bottles of NOS though, as the air compressor seems suited to handle the task.\\n\\nOnce the turbo has spooled up, the air compressor\\'s job is done. Now the electric motor refills the tank so the Power Pulse system is ready to help out the next time it\\'s needed.\\n\\n_______________________________________\\n\\nFollow Motor Authority on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.'}, {'id': 255073, 'ended': True, 'length': 530, 'text': 'Spread the love\\n\\n\\nAtmore, AL — Allegedly responding to their mistreatment, prisoners in at the Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, about 50 miles north of Mobile, began to riot early Saturday morning.\\n\\nEarly reports indicate that a correctional officer was stabbed 9 times and the warden, at least once Friday night which led to the riots.

Unfortunately, Linux has few defenses against performance interference in shared resources such as processor caches and memory buses, so applications in a cloud can experience unpredictable performance caused by other program\\'s behavior,\" the researchers write.\\n\\n\"Our solution, CPI2, uses cycles-per-instruction (CPI) data obtained by hardware performance counters to identify problems, select the likely perpetrators, and then optionally throttle them so that the victims can return to their expected behavior. It automatically learns normal and anomalous behaviors by aggregating data from multiple tasks in the same job.\"\\n\\nIn essence, CPI2 lets Google engineers isolate poor performance down to a single task running on a single processor within a cluster of thousands, then drill down to it and select to throttle that task, without causing a CPU overhead of more than 0.1 per cent. It requires no special hardware and its only software dependency appears to be use of Linux.\\n\\nCPI2 lets Google gather information on the expected CPU cycles-per-instruction (CPI) of any particular task, build standard resource profiles from this data, and then use these profiles to help the web giant identify tasks that are taking more cycles-per-instruction than usual to get executed (\"victims\") and the tasks that may be causing this disruption (\"antagonists\"). Software agents can then throttle the antagonists so the victims stop fretting and get back to work (Sounds a bit rough–Ed).\\n\\nThe \"vast majority\" of Google\\'s machines run multiple tasks, the company wrote. These jobs are either latency-sensitive or batch-based, and are themselves typically composed of multiple tasks. 96 per cent of the tasks running on Google servers are part of a job with at least 10 tasks, and 87 per cent of the tasks are part of a job with 100 or more tasks.\\n\\nBut these tasks can interfere with each other through foul-ups relating to processor caches and memory allocation problems, causing the latency of a task within an application to skyrocket – something that ad-slinger Google wants to avoid at all costs.\\n\\nTo help it control latency spikes on each processor on a task-by-task basis, Google has rolled out CPI monitoring across all of its production servers. It derives its CPI data by measuring processor hardware counters, according to CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.REF divided by INSTRUCTIONS_RETIRED .\\n\\nGoogle gathers this data for a 10 second period once every minute via a perf_event tool in counting mode, rather than sampling mode. Total CPU overhead of the system is less than 0.1% and leads to no visible latency impact.\\n\\nDon\\'t worry \\'victim\\', the agents will save you!\\n\\nCPI is calculated to take account of variances in the type of CPU being run on, Google said, as typical clusters will run across a large range of platforms. CPI values are measured and analyzed locally by an agent that runs on every machine (pictured).

Some Roma families had to be evacuated from their homes and are now living at undisclosed addresses.\\n\\nThe following night a smaller group also protested and kicked at the doors of a building they believed housed members of the Roma community.\\n\\nIt was the culmination of tension which has been building for some time – most of it whipped up over social media – over street begging and crime in the city.

Most have since been taken down, only to be replaced with new pages.\\n\\nA counter-demonstration in the city last night, organised by Waterford Against Racism, called for calm and opposed any attempt to tackle local problems through vigilantism.

Modern ayurvedacharayas, homoeopaths and other Ayush doctors may soon be allowed to conduct non-invasive abortions. The health ministry has worked out changes to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Amendment Bill. The revised bill proposes to allow Ayush doctors to conduct non-invasive procedures on women seeking to terminate pregnancy. The draft bill will soon be sent to the Cabinet.\\n\\n\"We have made revisions to the earlier draft and proposed that Ayush doctors who are registered healthcare specialists be allowed to carry out non-invasive procedure, which would mean prescribing medicines etc,\" a senior health ministry official told TOI.\\n\\nAnother key amendment seeks to increase the period for abortion to 24 weeks from the present 20 weeks. The government\\'s proposal, originally formulated taking a cue from a study conducted by Population Council, is aimed at increasing access to safe abortion by expanding the number of healthcare providers. Estimates show around 7 million abortions are conducted in India every year and over 50% of them are said to be illegal.\\n\\nInitially, the government had decided to allow midwives and Ayush doctors to do even invasive procedures for abortion, but dropped it following mounting objections from allopathic practitioners, particularly Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI). IMA, a pan India voluntary organization with a membership of 2.5 lakh allopathic practitioners, said even the latest move can put patients at risk as well as allow unethical practices and sex selective abortions.\\n\\nTOI\\n\\nDon\\'t Miss 40.7 K SHARES 16.5 K SHARES 9.9 K SHARES 9.4 K SHARES 3.9 K SHARES\\n\\n\"MTP is a procedure meant to be conducted by an allopathic doctor only. It is not possible to allow restricted practice. How will the government monitor whether a person is conducting abortion through medicine or doing invasive procedures,\" says IMA secretary general Dr KK Aggarwal. According to Dr Aggarwal, abortions by a non-MBBS doctor can lead to critical medical conditions arising out of excessive bleeding or incomplete abortions, which can be difficult to handle.\\n\\nMinistry officials say FOGSI members were part of the consultations and initially supported the amendments. However, FOGSI has maintained that it changed its position after a thorough discussion. \"Expanding the number and type of providers able to legally perform abortion services, including manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) and medical abortion (MA), could greatly expand women\\'s access to safe abortion and save many lives each year,\" Population Council said in a note on the issue.\\n\\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) also seems to endorse the government\\'s proposal. A technical and policy guidance for health systems by WHO released in 2012 states, \"Abortion care can be safely provided by any properly trained health-care provider, including mid-level providers....(e.g. midwives, nurse practitioners, clinical officers, physician assistants, family welfare visitors, and others) who are trained to provide basic clinical procedures related to reproductive health...\"\\n\\nTOI\\n\\nTraditionally, mid-wives have played a key role in catering to urgent medical needs, especially attending to pregnant women for child delivery or even for abortion, in rural areas and villages that lacked medical facilities. Though with time government health centres and private players reached many such villages, mid-wives continue to exist and attend to many emergencies even today. The government\\'s proposal to involve Ayush doctors has also found support from the women and child development ministry, National Commission for Women and other women\\'s groups.\\n\\n(Originally published in The Times of India)'}, {'id': 255087, 'ended': True, 'length': 473, 'text': 'San Diego Harbor Police arrest a man after running across the Lindbergh Field airport runway Image credit: ABC News\\n\\nA Marine recruit possibly escaping boot camp was arrested after allegedly running across an open runway at busy San Diego International, stealing a van, then colliding with a tow vehicle.\\n\\nJust after 6 a.m. on Thursday, Harbor Police in San Diego received a call from Lindbergh Field Airport with reports of a fence alarm sounding off.

The agent, along with Massachusetts state troopers Joel Gagne and Curtis Cinelli, had been questioning Todashev about an unsolved triple murder in Waltham, Massachusetts, in which someone slit the throats of three drug dealers.\\n\\nThe murder took place on the 10th anniversary of 9/11; the killers had lain their victims with heads turned to one side, and dumped a pound and a half of marijuana on two of the bodies, leaving $5,000 at the scene of the crime. The victims were Raphael Teken, Erik Weissman, and Tsarnaev\\'s friend and sparring partner Brendan Mess. Tsarnaev, a Golden Gloves boxing champion, trained at the same gym with both Mess and Todahsev, an MMA fighter.\\n\\nTodashev was said to be midway through writing out a confession that implicated himself and the elder bombing suspect when something went wrong.\\n\\nAccording to the officers in the room, Todashev hit McFarlane on the head with a coffee table and then proceeded to charge Cinelli with a metal broomstick. Gagne was outside at the time, making calls to the Middlesex district attorney. McFarlane shot Todashev seven times in two bursts, including once in the top of the head and three times in the back. Todashev was allegedly on the ground preparing to lunge, when McFarlane shot the second time. Investigations conducted by the Department of Justice and Florida State Attorney Jeffery Ashton cleared McFarlane of any wrongdoing, arguing he shot in self-defense.\\n\\nHassan Shibly, the director of the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is filing the \"notice of claim\" on behalf of Todashev\\'s family today. Under the Federal Torts Claims Act they must submit this document to the FBI before they can formally sue. In the claim they cite McFarlane\\'s checkered past as a police officer in Oakland, California; the bureau\\'s negligence in hiring him; and the undue pressure placed on Todashev as well as his friends and family after the marathon bombings.\\n\\nMcFarlane was the subject of two police brutality lawsuits and four internal affairs investigations. He pleaded the fifth during one of the most high-profile trials against Oakland police when officers were charged with beating, kidnapping, and planting false evidence. The department settled out of court. McFarlane was still receiving a pension from the Oakland police department when he shot Todashev.\\n\\n\"The FBI was negligent in hiring McFarlane,\" lawyers acting for Todashev\\'s parents argue in the claim. They also criticize the Department of Justice for not having a \"disinterested investigator\" question McFarlane about the shooting. The FBI has been scrutinized for their internal investigations, after a New York Times report found that the agency cleared every single agent in more than 150 investigations into shootings or deaths since 1993. McFarlane declined requests to be interviewed by the state attorney who conducted an independent investigation.\\n\\nNowhere in the claim is it denied that Todashev attacked an agent; his parents say law enforcement officers breached a duty to keep their son safe by interviewing him in his home, and leaving him alone with only one agent and one officer in the room. According to Ashton\\'s report, the agent, the troopers, and a Joint Terrorism Task Force officer, originally agreed to keep four members of law enforcement in the room at all times. They also argue that threatening Todashev\\'s friends to become informants or face immigration problems caused him to act out and led him to \"falsely confessing to crimes he did not commit.\"\\n\\n\"I want justice first and foremost,\" Todashev\\'s father, Abdul-Baki Todashev, told the Daily Beast from Moscow. \"I never thought that things like this happen outside of the movies. I never realized law enforcement could ever do this, walk in and shoot somebody. I want to shine some light on this situation.\"\\n\\nAgents began to question Todashev about his relationship to Tsarnaev on April 21, 2013, shortly after the Tsarnaev brothers were identified as the suspects in the Boston Marathon attacks. Todashev\\'s girlfriend, Tatiana Gruzdeva, and his friend Ashurmamad Miraliev, say they were asked to become FBI informants before they were detained and deported.

While Ewing\\'s bill sailed quickly through the House, it stalled in the Senate, as Sen. Gramm desired stricter deregulatory language be inserted into the bill. Gramm opposed any language that could provide the SEC or the CFTC with any hope of authority in regulating or oversight of financial derivatives and swaps. Gramm\\'s opposition held the bill in limbo until Congress went into recess for the 2000 election. Throughout the better part of the year Gramm, Lugar and Ewing worked with the President\\'s Working Group on Financial Markets—most specifically, Treasury Secretary [Larry] Summers, CFTC Chairman [William[ Rainer and SEC Chairman [Arthur] Levitt—to strike a deal on the bill.\\n\\nThe final version of the bill included stronger deregulatory language, but it isn\\'t clear whether many lawmakers knew that it was in there. (This was around the time that the country was embroiled in a contentious presidential vote recount in Florida.)\\n\\nThe CFMA made its way through Congress on the back of a must-pass, 11,000-page bill to fund the government that year. This is where Sanders comes in, he joined a majority of Democrats and Republicans in approving the omnibus bill, which was signed into law by Bill Clinton.\\n\\nBill Clinton has since said that he regrets that decision.'}, {'id': 255094, 'ended': True, 'length': 378, 'text': \"Opened two years ago in Neuschonau, Bavaria, in Germany, the tree-top walk is the longest of it's kind at 1300 meters that takes you to an impressive height of 25 meters above the tree tops.

That\\'s nearly two-thirds of young adults who qualify for Obamacare marketplace coverage in the 34 states.\\n\\nAn additional one million young adults will also now qualify for Medicaid coverage under Obamacare\\'s expansion of the program.

These stories tend to ignore the reality that many of these plans allure customers with deceptively low monthly premiums, but offer skimpy benefits, fail to cover out-of-pocket costs, and come loaded with high deductibles that are of little help in the case of a medical emergency.

Farrelly is truly an unsung hero—staying humble, she doesn\\'t say much, but her feet certainly do the talking.\\n\\nYet last December, at the age of 27, due to injuries she sustained from a car crash, Farrelly announced she was giving up the sport that had brought her so much joy.\\n\\nThe accident took place over a year earlier in September 2015. Farrelly was driving when another car came speeding around the corner, skidded into her lane and hit her straight on the driver\\'s side. The head-on collision deployed both airbags and totaled Farrelly\\'s car, forcing her to climb through the back of the vehicle to get out.\\n\\n[More from Excelle Sports: After the Whistle Blows: Learning to love life when you\\'re forced to say goodbye to your sport]\\n\\n\"The accident was crazy because, at the time, I had no idea of the impact it would have on my future and my life,\" Farrelly told me. \"At the time of the accident, I declined treatment from the ambulance—I just wanted to go home. In all honesty, I kind of regret not taking help from the paramedics. My instinct has always been to just pretend to be OK. That\\'s what we learn as athletes and professionals—to push through it. That pain is weakness. I was hurting and I was too proud to admit it.\"\\n\\nWhen she retired, Farrelly was on Seattle Reign FC\\'s roster, although she had yet to play with the team. The year before, she had been on the Boston Breakers\\' roster but had sat out the 2016 season with neck and back injuries from the crash. Eight months later, she learned she had also suffered a concussion.\\n\\n\"All of a sudden, I just wasn\\'t the person I had been for 25 years,\" she said of the effects of the concussion. \"I felt so, so alone. Every moment was masked in this layer of fog that I could not seem to break through. I had no energy. I was depressed. I started distancing myself from everyone who loved me.\"\\n\\nSuddenly, Farrelly, who started playing soccer professionally for the Women\\'s Professional League in 2011 after a decorated career at University of Virginia, found herself in a dark place.\\n\\n\"My time since the accident has been the most difficult time of my life,\" she said. \"Aside from losing my health and career, I was forced to face all of my demons. When I tell you that every single thing from my past came crashing down on me, I mean every single thing: family issues, sexual assault, abuse, a long history of an eating disorder … All of it. I felt like I was facing the wreckage without any clue of who I was. I felt like I had absolutely nothing.\"\\n\\nThe situation became unbearable and deeply overwhelming, especially immediately after the accident. Farrelly says she couldn\\'t sleep or read, suffered terrible migraines and was even unable to walk or run. Facing what seemed like insurmountable challenges, she felt beyond hopeless in her own skin.\\n\\n[More from Excelle Sports: Sinead Farrelly retires from pro soccer, one year after car accident]\\n\\n\"I did not want to live anymore. I would wake up in the morning so panicked because it felt too heavy to have to go through an entire day all over again,\" she said.\\n\\nThe accident turned out to also be a catalyst for Farrelly to question her real identity. The sport had been her fulcrum up to that point. She struggled, as many players do, to reconcile who she would be without soccer. Last December, she announced her retirement on Facebook.\\n\\n\"Soccer was my outlet when times were hard,\" Farrelly wrote on her page of the decision. \"It was a place I felt safe, yet it continued to push me past my comfort zone day after day. Losing soccer for me was losing my identity. And with the loss of that came the loss of everything.\"\\n\\nWhile Farrelly tried to come back to soccer, she knew she had to listen to her body.

We\\'ve done a poor job of introducing me and an incredibly poor job of reaching out to opinion leaders in the atheist movement. Undoubtedly, the behind-closed-doors decision to make what was bound to be a controversial hiring decision should have been tempered by a more comprehensive and immediate introduction and explanation of why I, of all people, was chosen for this position.\\n\\nI have identified as a non-theist for a long time, but I am very new to this movement. This is not because I don\\'t care about the issues you care about, I very much do, but they have not been my focus and, because of that, I really didn\\'t realize how bad things were until recently. My career and my focus have been very issue centered, some of these issues overlapped with my own secular beliefs, but the fact is that issue-focused work tends to create a very insular worldview. So, in many ways, I am a recent convert, not to your beliefs, but to your cause.\\n\\nWhich is where I have made another mistake. This community is very engaged and very well-informed and I have done my best to educate myself quickly, but there are things I have missed on the way. My recollection of statistics about Republicans from 20 years ago, for example, is not really the best gauge of Republicans now. Sometimes I forget that that was an entire generation ago, it doesn\\'t seem that long to me. And I have to admit that my claims that the majority of Republicans are pro-choice, OK with gay rights, and for the separation of church and state were as much a result of wishful thinking as they were of ignorance. I have had statistics shown to me that do indeed prove I was dead wrong on this front.\\n\\nAnd I need your help on this front. I am trying, but I just am not as well-educated about this as those people who have focused on this cause their whole lives. I know the goals of the coalition and am well-versed in those goals and don\\'t doubt my ability to execute them, but as for the wider culture of the secular movement and the less specific goals thereof, I will need more time to learn the nuances, and I hope you will help me rather than condemning me for my neophyte status.\\n\\nMy final big mistake is that I\\'ve been trying to focus exclusively on my positives without acknowledging my negatives and without engaging with them openly and honestly. This is a fault of being in politics, it makes you quite the bullshit artist. I should have known better in this community than to think I could dance around questions without being called on it. So let me say that you are right. You are right that I\\'ve worked for and support a party that disagrees, in majority but not in totality, with many of your goals. But I was working for causes that I cared very deeply about, and I will not apologize for doing that. And I will not abandon my party because other people have taken it in a direction I disagree with. It is better for all of us if we can bring the party back in line with the goals of the secular community and I really do think that is possible.\\n\\nSo, just to recap, I haven\\'t done a good enough job introducing myself, I haven\\'t had the time to educate myself as thoroughly as the community is educated, and I have not been clear on acknowledging that there were some negatives to my background. That said, I think I bring a lot to the table that I hope you can appreciate.\\n\\nI am an experienced lobbyist and I know the workings of DC very well.

If you slow down this tape you see what happens, it is a very short period of time from when the car starts rolling to when a gun is out and he\\'s shot in the head,\" Deters told reporters on Wednesday.\\n\\n\\'Senseless\\' and \\'asinine\\': prosecutor\\'s words on Samuel DuBose killing a win for reformers Read more\\n\\nThe footage shows that Tensing falls back, after DuBose is killed instantly by a single shot to the head and immediately chases after the vehicle. Deters said that DuBose\\'s limp body probably caused the car to accelerate.\\n\\nA Guardian analysis of the nearly 28 minutes\\' worth of Tensing\\'s body-camera footage released by the prosecutor\\'s office also shows the aftermath of the shooting and reveals that on three occasions, two other police officers repeat Tensing\\'s account that he was dragged by DuBose, and one of these officers claims to have witnessed it occurring.\\n\\nTensing repeats, multiple times throughout the footage, the claim that he was dragged by DuBose\\'s vehicle. But at five minutes and 44 seconds into the video, he states: \"I think I\\'m OK. He was just dragging me.\"\\n\\nTo which a second officer, who stands out of the frame, replies: \"Yeah, I saw that.\"\\n\\nTensing continues: \"I thought I was going to get run over. I was trying to stop him.\"\\n\\nThen, at six minutes and 54 seconds into the footage, while Tensing is seemingly conversing with the same officer, he states: \"He was dragging me, man.\"\\n\\nThe officer replies, \"Yeah.\" To which Tensing continues: \"I got my hand and my arm caught inside.\" The officer then replies, \"Yeah, I saw that.\"\\n\\nThe identity of this officer is not immediately clear. A copy of the University of Cincinnati police division\\'s information report on the shooting names university police officer Phillip Kidd as a witness to the entire event.\\n\\nThe information report, written by UC police officer Eric Weibel, states: \"Officer Kidd told me that he witnessed the Honda Accord [DuBose\\'s vehicle] drag Officer Tensing, and that he witnessed Officer Tensing fire a single shot.\"\\n\\nWeibel\\'s report continues: \"Looking at Officer Tensing\\'s uniform, I could see that the back of his pants and shirt looked as if it had been dragged over a rough surface.\"\\n\\nAbout 14 minutes into the video, while Tensing is still at the site of the shooting, but has now moved further away from DuBose\\'s crashed car, he is instructed by a third officer to indicate where the altercation had started.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Prosecutor announces charges against officer for Samuel DuBose shooting. WARNING: contains footage of the fatal incident. Link to video\\n\\nThis officer appears to be a member of the Cincinnati police department and wears a sergeant\\'s lapel on his arm. He states: \"You can talk about anything you want except for what happened [sic]. The only thing that I ask of you is where did it start?\"\\n\\nTensing replies: \"I initiated the traffic stop at Vine and Thill.\"\\n\\nThe two officers then clarify the direction Tensing was driving. The sergeant then states: \"And, it looks like you got dragged if I\\'m understanding, looking …\"\\n\\nTo which Tensing replies: \"Yes.\"\\n\\nThe Hamilton County prosecutor\\'s office did not reply to a question from the Guardian after Deter\\'s press conference over whether any other officers were being investigated in relation to the incident.\\n\\nA representative for the UC police referred all questions to the prosecutor\\'s office.

We also chose our favorite 5\" touchscreen then paired it with a small USB powered driver board through our 50pin to 40pin + AR1100 Adapter. The screen itself is commonly seen in consumer electronics such as miniature TVs, GPSs, handheld games, car displays, etc. It comes with a 40-pin connector that has eight red, eight green, and eight blue parallel pins for 24-bit color capability.\\n\\nThe driver board only has an HDMI input but for Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black and other computers. HDMI is the best quality output available so you\\'ll get a great looking display. The display is very easy to use - simply connect the USB power cable to 5V power supply that can provide 500mA, then connect a digital video source to one of the HDMI port. Voila, a display! To demonstrate it, we took some photos with the display connected to a Raspberry Pi, but it will also work connected to any device with HDMI output. We also noted it does not work with a Raspberry Pi + Windows 10 IOT yet.\\n\\nThe touchscreen controller shows up as a plain \\'HID Mouse\\' device - and we do the touch screen calibration step here so you can plug and play. Works with any computer, just plug a mini B cable from the touch adapter to the computer USB port. If you want to calibrate it again, Microchip has Windows-only calibration software. For Linux users, check out xinput_calibrator which is the general-use X11 calibration software.\\n\\nThere\\'s a little wired PCB with little buttons that let you enter a menu system for adjusting brightness, color and contrast.

You can see our suggested config.txt in the Technical details tab. The easiest way to edit the config.txt is to put the Pi SD card into an every day computer and edit config.txt with any text editor and save.

Sometimes they are relatively easy and reward well enough that they become popular. Other times it takes significant effort and planning just to get through an STF, and those queues get ignored by most of the community.\\n\\nOne thing is for sure, a queues popularity will change over time, as do the techniques used to get through them. The best example is \"I\\'ve got Kang!\" has evolved from being a job you took out of necessity, to something that\\'s little more than a speedbump in the race to complete a CSA in under 30 seconds.\\n\\nThe new missions have their fair share of confusion at the moment that\\'s impacting not only the normals but advanced and elite queues as well. I\\'ve had greater success with runs set up privately through Redditchat or the various DPS channels – but at the same time, I\\'ve also watched Elites fail in the first 30 seconds with a highly-skilled team, just because someone pushed a Battleship to close to the Starbase with a mistimed tractor beam repulsor.\\n\\nOne last point before the briefing: these techniques represent the efforts of many players, and while they worked for us, they may not be the only way to beat this STF. If you\\'ve come across other methods, don\\'t hesitate to share them in the comments below.\\n\\nMission Brief: The Tzenkethi Front\\n\\nRegardless of the difficulty (normal, advanced and elite), the mission parameters remain essentially the same. A Tzenkethi invasion force has moved five small staging bases into the Eta Serpentis system, and are launching waves of attacks against the planet\\'s defences (Klingon Starbase).\\n\\nYour goal is to intercept the Tzenkethi Battleships – marked by the Protomatter Bomb warning sign on your main viewscreen. In the process of destroying the battleship, you recover the Protomatter Bomb and then use it against one of the five Tzenkethi staging bases.\\n\\nThe STF comes with voice prompts and reminders, letting you know when a player has picked up the bomb, and when a base is destroyed. When you pick up the bomb, your ship will be given a visual cue identifying that you have the bomb. If you are destroyed, the protomatter bomb you carry is destroyed with you.\\n\\nThe Football (Protomatter Bomb)\\n\\nWhile in Tzenkethi hands, the protomatter bombs are targeted at your station. They can be deployed fairly close to the station, and the bomb itself cannot be intercepted by weapons or space magic. At about a 2km range, a Battleship can easily deploy the device and hit your station. (It\\'s instantaneous) For Normal and Advanced runs, the optional objective is to prevent damage to the station for additional marks. For Elite runs, failure to stop this attack on your station is an auto failure.\\n\\nWhen the football is in a players hands, your ship becomes impacted by the bizarre effects of protomatter. The first thing you will notice is that your ship is unable to go to full impulse, and you appear to be covered in a type of exotic radiation. This becomes problematic as you try to get to the Tzenkethi bases quickly.\\n\\nWarning: If you use a teleport ability like Trajector Jump you will drop the bomb and a Tzenkethi group will immediately warp in and claim the bomb. (TY ElectrumLeopard)\\n\\nAdditionally – if you carry the bomb with a Romulan ship, do not use the singularity jump or you will lose the bomb; same thing with the singularity shadows. (TY Nandos)\\n\\nSome players will experience a visual glitch in that the bomb may appear to \\'drop\\' along the way. This appears to be a coding problem in the game, or if you prefer, a false image caused by temporal distortion (a QA happy accident). As long as you have the main marker showing you have the bomb, it will not release until you are in range when you are offered an interaction button to drop the bomb. Deploying the bomb takes a short amount of time, and if you\\'re taking damage, the bomb will not drop. A second visual glitch appears to happen when you switch alts and make multiple runs – occasionally the bomb identification will not show. There is no easy fix other than restarting the game after you complete the mission.\\n\\nThe Tzenkethi\\n\\nThe Tzenkethi battle groups operate in waves. You will encounter groups of frigates on an ongoing basis, while the bomb groups consisting of a battleship, and a cruiser to provide support.

Sum up all of who you are — your aspirations, perspective, strengths, intellect, personality, all of it — in one page, single spaced.\\n\\nHit the panic button.\\n\\nYou know what I do when faced with a problem? I ask the Internet. So do a Google search — I dare you — for the phrase \"admissions essay advice\" and see the mess you get.\\n\\nOne list on a prominent Web site includes the following suggestions (in order, with some paraphrasing): be cautious and then, immediately afterward, be controversial.\\n\\nO.K. Got it: Say something risky without taking chances. That\\'s not helpful.\\n\\nNeither is the advice you get from most admissions officers when you ask them.\\n\\n\"Just be yourself,\" they say.

It demands that you understand yourself in a way that perhaps no one has ever asked of you. It demands that you ask yourself questions perhaps no teacher has ever asked. Questions like:\\n\\nWhat invigorates/inspires/angers me?\\n\\nWhat do I wish we talked or learned about in school?\\n\\nWhat are my most strongly held opinions and where do they come from?\\n\\nWhat are the differences between how I see myself and how others see me?\\n\\nWhat pieces of my life transform my thinking (whether I want them to or not)?\\n\\nWhat ideas fire me up just when everyone else is cooling down?\\n\\nThese aren\\'t easy questions. They are dangerous questions. They are questions with teeth, questions that require you to stake out a position, to have an opinion and to express something of substance.\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to literally answer one of those questions to write a good admissions essay (though you could); think of the list as a set of examples.\\n\\nBeing honest and forceful about yourself may make some adults around you nervous; it\\'s not \"safe.\" They will worry that you are being too controversial or informal. You should listen carefully and try to see your writing from their perspective. But you should feel comfortable ignoring advice that does not feel right.\\n\\nIf you are not interested in thinking about the big issues (or the small ones) around community service, here is some radical advice: Don\\'t write about it.\\n\\nIf you love your sport, but it isn\\'t what you are itching to talk about when you get out of bed, don\\'t write about it.\\n\\nWriting about service or determination reflects important qualities, but no one in our applicant pools writes about how quickly they quit or how much they hate helping society. If you write the \"safe\" essay, how will you stand apart?\\n\\nI wrote of your goals, now here is ours: to build the most interesting and intellectually diverse class we can. We want to fill our seats with students who have things to say, who will challenge conventions and advance conversations, who will learn from each other.\\n\\nThe answers to those dangerous questions define who you are. They reflect what you value and how you think, as well as how you will enhance our community and classrooms. You need to be confident and proud enough to stand behind those ideas because if you won\\'t, why would an admissions officer choose to stand behind you?\\n\\nAs a reader, I want to be in your corner, to fight for your cause in a hypercompetitive applicant pool.

The waiver had meant that Puerto Rico had the option of importing food, fuel and supplies more quickly, and for half the cost, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.\\n\\nWith the 1920 law back in effect, the island is now required to pay much higher costs to import supplies. The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by U.S.-owned and operated ships, which are more expensive vessels than others in the global marketplace. That\\'s meant that Puerto Rico pays double the costs to import goods from the U.S. mainland compared with neighboring islands ― and that U.S. vessels are making bank.\\n\\nThe return to higher shipping costs won\\'t help Puerto Rico as it tries to climb out of economic devastation. Nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans on the island still don\\'t have drinking water since Maria hit nearly three weeks ago. Just 15 percent have electricity. Many people still haven\\'t heard from loved ones, and at least 39 deaths have been attributed to the storm.\\n\\nLapan said DHS is \"always prepared to review requests on a case-by-case basis and respond quickly\" to possible waivers of the Jones Act. But those decisions have to be related to national defense, he said, and are not driven by cost-related matters.\\n\\n\"We believe that extending the waiver is unnecessary to support the humanitarian relief efforts on the island,\" Lapan said. \"There is an ample supply of Jones Act-qualified vessels to ensure that cargo is able to reach Puerto Rico.\"\\n\\nMario Tama via Getty Images Maria Chiclano, who has no running water or power in her home, washes clothes with her sons in the Espiritu Santo river during heavy rains, more than two weeks after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico.\\n\\nDespite DHS\\' position, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said Monday night that he wants another extension of the Jones Act waiver.\\n\\n\"I think we should have it,\" Rossello told CBS News\\' David Begnaud. \"In this emergency phase, while we\\'re looking to sustain and save lives, we should have all of the assets at hand.\"\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump, who is spending Monday golfing, had originally hedged on waiving the Jones Act for Puerto Rico at all, saying \"a lot of shippers\" didn\\'t want him to do it. He eventually caved to pressure from lawmakers including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).\\n\\nMcCain has been pushing to get rid of the Jones Act altogether. It costs Puerto Rico hundreds of millions of dollars every year, and he recently introduced legislation to nix the law.\\n\\n\"Now that the temporary Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico has expired, it is more important than ever for Congress to pass my bill to permanently exempt Puerto Rico from this archaic and burdensome law,\" McCain said in a statement to HuffPost. \"Until we provide Puerto Rico with long-term relief, the Jones Act will continue to hinder much-needed efforts to help the people of Puerto Rico recover and rebuild from Hurricane Maria.\"'}, {'id': 255124, 'ended': True, 'length': 357, 'text': 'Are you guys ready to see the winners of the 2012 Dickerdoodle contest?

Led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the study was published in Nature.\\n\\nWe already knew that Venus has a weird super-rotation, where its winds can rotate 60 times faster than the planet. But it seems that on the night side, this process is even more chaotic than on the day side.\\n\\n\"This study challenges our current understanding of climate modelling and, specifically, the super-rotation, which is a key phenomenon seen at Venus,\" said Håkan Svedhem, ESA Project Scientist for Venus Express, in a statement.\\n\\nThe team found that night-side clouds form large, irregular patterns, dominated by waves that appear to stand still in the atmosphere, called stationary waves. In January of this year, a huge stationary wave was seen on Venus by the Akatsuki spacecraft, stretching for more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles).\\n\\nIn this study, the scientists used data from the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) to study the night side, using infrared to study the clouds. They found they did not move with the atmosphere, an unexpected discovery that was later confirmed by Akatsuki.\\n\\nStationary waves are thought to form over mountains or other high-elevation regions. Weirdly though, in this data stationary waves were missing in the intermediate and lower cloud levels, up to about 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the surface.\\n\\n\"We expected to find these waves in the lower levels because we see them in the upper levels, and we thought that they rose up through the cloud from the surface,\" co-author Ricardo Hueso of the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao, Spain, in the statement. \"It\\'s an unexpected result for sure, and we\\'ll all need to revisit our models of Venus to explore its meaning.\"\\n\\nAkatsuki is continuing to orbit Venus, so it may be able to shed some light on some of the weird things going on with the planet.\\n\\nWN.com, Jim Berrie'}, {'id': 255128, 'ended': False, 'length': 1024, 'text': 'How to Make My Favorite Beers Visualization How to Make My Favorite Beers Visualization 8/18/2015\\n\\nSince I seemed to get quite a bit of interest about how to make My Favorite Beers Viz on Reddit, I thought I\\'d go ahead and create a post explaining the process.

On Untappd\\'s Website , you are able to become a \"Supporter\". Once you do that, you get access to all of your data in an .xls or .csv format. Please note that it costs $5 to become a supporter. Also, if you don\\'t cancel your subscription, they will charge you that $5 every month. So, I just paid the $5, downloaded my data, then canceled my subscription so I don\\'t get charged again. Once you download the data, go ahead and open it up in Excel.Once you have the data opened up, you will see there are fields for the Brewery State and Brewery City. What we need to do is copy both of those and paste them into this Batch Geocode Website so we can create our Brewery Map later. You could try to just use the Brewery State and City to map in Tableau, but a lot of times, Tableau either won\\'t recognize the city, or it will come back as an ambiguous location. So, just paste the city and state into the box on that website, choose Batch Geocode Output Options to be only Latitude and Longitude, then click Geocode. This may take a little while (its best to do about 100 at a time), but it will eventually spit out all of the Latitudes and Longitudes. Then, create two new columns in your spreadsheet and paste the values into there. You will have to use Text-to-Columns with a comma delimiter to split these out. Then you will be good to go ahead and load the data up into Tableau.The only manipulation I did of the data once inside Tableau was a little bit of grouping for the Beer Type field. Untappd uses a lot of different beer types and I just wanted to group some of the similar ones up, so I wasn\\'t stuck with 100 different groups. An example of this is combining all of the different IPA sytles into one over-arching category: IPA. This step is completely optional, but I think it looks much nicer only having 15-20 different groups when looking at the Style filter on the visualization.Doing this is pretty easy. Just drag out the Beer Type field, then Ctrl-Click multiple styles you think would be grouped well together. Once you have multiple types selected, right click and choose \"Group\". You can see an example photo to the right. Then, you can right click your new group and choose \"Edit Alias\" to rename your group. Do this to all the styles you feel necessary to group. I used this website as reference.This is probably the toughest part of this whole visualization. This is primarily because of using the stars to signify ranking. Thinking about it, you need not only a full star image, but you also need fractions of that star (1/2 of a star, 3/4 of a star, etc.) I learned how to do this by downloading this workbook . They did a really great job of getting this star rating system to work correctly in Tableau. So, to do this, you are going to need 9 calculated fields:Next, we are going to right-click our index measure and choose \"Convert to Discrete\". After doing that, you can drag it out to Rows.

The reason we have to do this is because some beers have identical names across breweries. For example, Bell\\'s, Mt.

Chris Christie (R) knew that Fort Lee, N.J., had issues with traffic congestion around the George Washington Bridge, long before he authorized a seemingly unnecessary study that closed down lanes to the bridge and made traffic even worse.\\n\\nFort Lee is an essential access point to New York City, serving as the gateway to the George Washington Bridge, which is the busiest bridge in the United States. In November 2010, Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich (D) wrote to Bill Baroni, deputy director of the Port Authority of New York and Jersey, and complained of traffic problems in the borough. The letter was obtained by The Record in a public records request.\\n\\n\"On approximately 20 occasions in the last forty days, our Borough has been completely gridlocked,\" wrote Sokolich to Baroni, who was Christie\\'s top official at the Port Authority. \"Traveling from the south to the north end of our Borough takes upwards of one hour. Our safety vehicles are unable to traverse our own thoroughfares to attend to emergencies which place our residents in harms way.\"\\n\\nDespite these concerns, on Sept. 9, 2013, Sokolich woke up to find that two of the three local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge had been closed, causing dangerous traffic jams in the borough on the first day of school. Neither he nor Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye -- who was appointed by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) -- were given any advance warning.\\n\\nThe closures were ordered by David Wildstein, then the director of interstate capital projects and an ally of Christie\\'s. They came just weeks after Sokolich refused to endorse Christie\\'s reelection bid. On Sept. 12, Sokolich said he believed the closures were \"punitive,\" although he later backed off that accusation.\\n\\nBaroni has stated that the closures were part of a traffic study, implying that Fort Lee may not need three access lanes.\\n\\n\"Every one of you, every one of you on this committee has people in your communities who sit in longer traffic every day because of the special lanes for Fort Lee,\" Baroni said in November.\\n\\nBut he acknowledged that no one ever sought approval for the study, which, without an alternative route, was guaranteed to create traffic congestion.\\n\\nAccording to The Record, a bridge official said Wildstein also specifically instructed him to keep the lane closures secret from Fort Lee officials. And records indicate, according to the paper, \"that traffic engineers predicted it would lead to 600-vehicle back-ups during the morning rush hour that would not subside until noon.\"\\n\\nWildstein and Baroni have since resigned and hired attorneys to represent them.\\n\\nIn a Dec. 17 press conference on the controversy, Christie stood by Baroni\\'s explanation for the closures, saying that while his appointees did not go through the proper channels for the closures, there was no malicious or political intent in what they did.\\n\\nStill, the controversy has continued to dog Christie, who is considered a possible 2016 presidential contender. Sen. John \"Jay\" Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, has asked the Transportation Department to review what happened in Fort Lee.\\n\\n\"While this type of decision tends to be local in nature, I am concerned about the larger federal implications of what appears to be political appointees abusing their power to hamper interstate commerce and safety without public notice,\" wrote Rockefeller in his letter to Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.\\n\\nThe inspector general of the Port Authority is also investigating the closures, and several state legislators continue to look into the matter.\\n\\nLast week, Christie said the controversy was \"not that big a deal\" even though reporters were \"obsessed\" with it.'}, {'id': 255131, 'ended': False, 'length': 1024, 'text': 'New household formations finally seem to be picking up, but it\\'s not because young people are moving out of mom and dad\\'s house, according to a study released Monday by the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley.\\n\\nIn fact, \"age groups younger than 55 collectively had negative household formation between 2014 and 2015, while 65- to 74-year-olds accounted for more than two-thirds of overall household formation,\" the report said.\\n\\nA separate report released Monday by Zillow found that first-time home buyers today are older, renting longer, are less likely to be married and are spending a lot more of their income on homes today versus first-time buyers in the 1970s and 1980s.\\n\\nBoth reports add to the growing body of research on why Millennials are taking so long to strike out on their own, which is of great interest to Realtors, home builders and economists.\\n\\nHistorically, population growth alone results in the formation of about 1.2 million new households per year on average, said Jed Kolko, author of the Terner Center report. During the recession, this number \"got down into only a few hundred thousand\" as more people stayed with parents longer or found roommates.\\n\\nRecent census data suggest that the rate of new household formation has started to improve, although there is conflicting data as to the start and size of the increase. The data cited most often showed a big year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter of last year, with gains continuing into this year.\\n\\nIt was assumed that Millennials, having found jobs, are now getting their own places.\\n\\nBut a recent report from the Pew Center showed that\\'s not true.\\n\\nEven though unemployment among 18- to 34-year olds has dropped dramatically — to 7.7 percent early this year from 12.4 percent in 2010 — people this age are less likely to be living independently. Only 67 percent were living independently early this year, compared with 69 percent in 2010 and 71 percent in 2007, the Pew report said.\\n\\nIf young adults are not increasingly striking out on their own, then what accounts for the increase in new household formation?\\n\\nKolko attempted to answer this question by adding up the population growth between the first half of 2015 and the first half of 2014 for various age groups and multiplying by each group\\'s headship rate. Headship is the percentage of adults who head a household.\\n\\nLike the Pew study, his analysis found that despite the job recovery, the percentage of young adults living with their parents continued to rise, even through June 2015.\\n\\nHe found that the headship rate fell or remained flat for all age groups from 20 to 64. \"The only notable increase in headship rate was for 65- to 74-year-olds,\" he said.\\n\\nHis conclusion: \"Household formation is being driven by overall population growth and the aging of the population, but not a broad increase in headship rates. The recent gain in household formation appears to be due to basic demographic shifts rather than the economic cycle.\"\\n\\nWhat the data can\\'t explain is why young adults are living at home even after they get a job.\\n\\n\"One contributing factor is that 25 to 34-year-olds are decreasingly likely to be married or cohabitating with a partner, and — unsurprisingly — married or cohabitating young adults rarely live with their parents (just 2% do), compared with 31% of those who aren\\'t living with a spouse or partner,\" Kolko wrote. The decline in marriage among young adults predates the recession.\\n\\nAnother possible factor is that \"rent affordability is worsening broadly,\" Kolko said. \"When young people move out, it is usually to rent, not to own.\" After the bubble burst, home prices fell precipitously, but rents did not. \"Demand for renting rose as people lost homes to foreclosure or couldn\\'t get a mortgage,\" he said.\\n\\nSaving up for a down payment on a home is harder when rents are rapidly rising.\\n\\nA third possible reason is that \"the quality of jobs being created\" is not good enough to let young people move out on their own, at least in the style they have become accustomed to.\\n\\nFirst-time home buyers: Zillow\\'s report on first-time home buyers echoes some of the same themes.\\n\\nIt found that:\\n\\n•First-time buyers are older than than they were in the past. The median age was about 32.5 in 2010-14, versus 29 in 1975-79.\\n\\n•Americans are renting longer before buying a home. The median was 6 years between 2010 and 2014, versus 2.6 years in 1970-74.\\n\\n•They are less likely to be married.

These increased requirements most likely have contributed to this decline.\\n\\nPlus, there are many other career options available than in the 1990s.

They say another possibility is that someone in one of the vehicles sprayed the area with a high-capacity assault weapon.\\n\\nTacarra\\'s condition was upgraded from critical to serious, a hospital official said Wednesday.\\n\\nThe shootings, mostly in neighborhoods on the South and West sides, underline what the residents already knew: It\\'s a dangerous time for the city\\'s children as well.\\n\\nBut since the recent shootings of young victims haven\\'t been deadly, they have received little attention outside Chicago. The children haven\\'t become national symbols of the city\\'s violence like 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee, who was lured into an alley last November with the promise of a juice box and shot to death, allegedly by gang members out to punish his father.\\n\\nOther children besides Kavan have been struck by gunfire while doing nothing other than being kids, leaving their families to wonder if there\\'s anything they can do to protect them. The victims include:\\n\\n— Six-year-old Jaylene Bermeo, who was drawing with sidewalk chalk on the evening of June 6 in the Logan Square neighborhood on the city\\'s northwest side when she was shot in the back. The bullet punctured her lung and lodged near her heart. Police say a 17-year-old boy accidentally shot the girl when he opened fire on rival gang members as he drove down the block.\\n\\n— Three-year-old Devon Quinn, who was with his dad on Father\\'s Day in a car in the Woodlawn neighborhood on the South Side when someone pulled up and fired at least 10 shots at the vehicle. Prosecutors say the gunman was a gang member who opened fire in a rival gang\\'s territory to pay tribute to a dead member of his own gang. At a court hearing, prosecutors said the boy was left paralyzed from the chest down and that he will never be able to move his limbs or even breathe on his own.\\n\\n— Five-year-old Taniyah Williams and her 8-year-old cousin, Corey Bondurant, who were playing with sparklers on the evening of July 4 in the West Englewood neighborhood on the South Side when someone sprayed the area with bullets. Taniyah was struck in the leg, as were a 19-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man. After the commotion, relatives discovered that 8-year-old Corey was also shot in the leg.\\n\\nSince her son Kavan was wounded, Brashear struggles with how to talk to him about the shooting, even as she continues taking him to doctor appointments and trying to determine what can be done about his facial scars.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how to explain it to him,\" she said of the boy who has been afraid to fall asleep since the incident and experiences nightmares when he does. \"How do you tell a kid, \\'Oh, you got shot'}, {'id': 255143, 'ended': True, 'length': 289, 'text': 'In this new ITS Podcast we have a really interesting three way interview with scientists from Karlsruhe Technical University and Daimler on their amazing autonomous driving acomplishment, a new milestone, through Bertha Benz Memorial route in the south of Germany.\\n\\nAs a preparation for that interview we have a Transportation in History minisection about that historical route Carl Benz\\'s wife drove, making the historical first long distance car drive 125 years ago.\\n\\nAs usual, we also have a news minisection, this time about the autonomous electric four seats pods they are using in London\\'s Heathrow airport, and their plans on using them on an actual british city, Milton Keynes.\\n\\nDownload Mp3 (30.4 MB – 42′:12\")\\n\\nDownloads: 815\\n\\nFor those willing to jump straight to the interview, it starts at 6′:10″\\n\\nProperty of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.\\n\\nInterview Related Links:\\n\\nNews Minisection\\n\\nSource:\\n\\nhttp://www.electric-vehiclenews.com/2013/10/battery-powered-driverless-cars-to-be.html\\n\\nTransportation in History\\n\\nSources\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertha_Benz_Memorial_Route\\n\\nhttp://www.bertha-benz.de'}, {'id': 255144, 'ended': False, 'length': 1024, 'text': \"Fees & Financial Aid :: Full-time Studies\\n\\nPlease note the Payment Options for BCIT.\\n\\nEnsuring your fees are paid on time reserves your place in your chosen full-time program.

Patty Jenkins\\' Wonder Woman has made a huge amount of money, and became an example of how to bring a hero to the screen with style and substance. We\\'re awaiting Aquaman\\'s first movie and the new Justice League film, a long-held dream for DC fans, with a sense of quiet anticipation. The sequel to Suicide Squad is being fast-tracked, and there\\'s a Martin Scorsese-produced Joker movie on the way… Strange things are afoot at the circle DC…\\n\\nYet with a roster of the most recognisable (and profitable) comic book characters on its books DC appear to be having trouble finding their feet. We\\'re post-Logan, post-Deadpool and each new direction a comic book movie succeeds with could well become a template for all that follow.\\n\\nSo, all eyes are on DC for the foreseeable future. Today we received confirmation that Matthew Vaughn is in talks with DC about the sequel to Man of Steel, and it could be a whole new take on the cinematic Superman.\\n\\nThe Kick-Ass director was in the mix at Warner Bros. when they were looking to bring about the new cinematic DCEU. The studio ultimately went with the Christopher Nolan/David S. Goyer re-invention of Superman and the visually impressive, yet emotionally cold Man of Steel was the first step into a wider franchise.\\n\\nCommenting on his 2010 pitch, before Man of Steel went into production, Vaughn offered his opinion to MTV on what a new Superman film should be,\\n\\n\"I think that\\'s the one thing not to do with Superman, trying to do the serious The Dark Knight version. Superman is about color and fun, or it should be, for me.\"\\n\\nSpeaking to us at the press junket for Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Vaughn confirmed to Scott Davis,\\n\\n\"I am planning another Kingman, I\\'ve written the treatment and some of the scenes…I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do next but I have had chats about Superman, I love Superman. \"If somebody asks me to do Indiana Jones, most of the superheros or Star Wars the fanboy in me can\\'t help but be excited.\"\\n\\nSee the interview below,\\n\\nMatthew Vaughn on the new Superman film\\n\\nTone has been a very difficult element for the DCEU. Though it came in the shadow of The Avengers, Man of Steel, and the follow-up Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, were cast firmly in the, often mocked, \\'dark and gritty\\' mould. At the time it was an understandable decision. Let the tone serve the story, and comparisons to the Marvel films would be moot. However the reaction to Batman v Superman gave the DCEU a stumble on its second step, and the trailers for Suicide Squad subsequently focused heavily on the film\\'s humour. There were dozens of news stories dedicated to how the Justice League film would be lighter and tone, and funnier.\\n\\nIf Vaughn, and his long time collaborative partner Jane Goldman, are on board for a new Superman film it could be a bold, stabilising step for the ongoing franchise. When the X-Men franchise from Bryan Singer (another Superman director) faltered with the execrable Last Stand, it was Vaughn and Goldman who reinvigorated the series with X-Men: First Class. They could well do the same with Superman.'}, {'id': 255146, 'ended': True, 'length': 377, 'text': '<b>Why <i>[Follow]</i> our Soundcloud?</b> We generally stream new releases to Soundcloud before anywhere else! <b>Enjoying the tune?</b> Please consider clicking the <i>[Repost]</i> ↻ button!

Firstly, his son Hafiz Zaenullah, his brother Asif Iqbal and another man – a stonemason called Khaliq Dad – were killed by a drone attack on Mr Khan\\'s home in December 2009. Secondly, he had filed a legal case in Pakistan against the American drone strikes, arguing that they constituted murder under domestic law. And thirdly – perhaps Mr Khan\\'s most serious crime – he was about to leave for Brussels to address European Union parliamentarians on the dangers of American drone strikes in Pakistan.\\n\\nIn Madiha Tahir\\'s recent documentary film Wounds of Waziristan, Mr Khan had talked about his family loss. His son Hafiz was a security guard at a local girls\\' school, and also studying for Grade 10. Asif, who had a Master\\'s in English, was a government employee. Karim Khan saw what was left of their bodies, \"covered in wounds\". He found some of their fingers in the rubble of his home.\\n\\nThanks to constant reports of his kidnapping in the courageous Pakistani media and to the Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court who ordered the Pakistani government to produce Karim Khan by next Thursday, the anti-drone campaigner is safe. For the moment.\\n\\nBut this is going to set the world on fire. The \"drone war\", as American journalists inevitably call it – after all, it\\'s not as if al-Qa\\'ida or the innocent victims are firing back with drones of their own – started under George W Bush, but most of the attacks, 384 of them since 2008, have been authorised by Mr Obama. The statistics of civilian deaths fluctuate wildly since most of the missiles are fired into the Pakistani frontier districts in which the government has little power. The minimum figure for civilian victims is almost 300 dead – some say almost 900 – out of a total of 2,500 killed. At least 50 people are believed to have been killed in follow-up strikes which slaughtered those going to the rescue of the wounded.\\n\\nOf course, the drone syndrome has spread across the Middle East. The missiles rain down on al-Qa\\'ida and civilians alike in Yemen. The Israelis fired them into Lebanon in 2006; when a youth on a motorcycle fired at a night-time drone over Beirut, it fired back a missile that destroyed a downtown civilian apartment block. In Gaza, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights reported 825 deaths from Israeli drones during the 2008-09 war, a large percentage of them civilians.\\n\\nPakistani witnesses have told me that the missiles don\\'t just appear suddenly in the sky. The drones arrive in clusters – 10 or 12 at a time, circling villages for an hour or two – a looking for targets on behalf of their \"pilots\" in the United States. Until at least 2009, the Americans flew drones – the most impressive was called the Reaper – from air bases inside Pakistan. Hence the sensitivities of the boys from the ISI and their irritation with Karim Khan.\\n\\nThe ethical disgrace of the drone syndrome is not that Mr Obama – or some US officer near Las Vegas – decides on the basis of satellite pictures, mobile phone calls, numbers dialled and the speed of vehicles, who should live or die. The really shameful aspect is that the drone war has become normal. It has gone on so long – and been the subject of so much protest, so regularly – that it has become banal, boring, matter-of-fact.\\n\\nIt was just the same in the 1990s when the US and Brits went hunting for Iraqi targets over the so-called \"no-fly zones\" in Iraq. For years they bombed and missiled \"military targets\" that supposedly threatened them. In the eight months up to August 1999, US and British pilots had fired more than 1,100 missiles against 359 Iraqi targets, flying about two-thirds as many missions as Nato pilots conducted over Yugoslavia during the 78-day bombardment of the same year. As well as anti-aircraft batteries, oil pipelines were blown up, storage depots destroyed and dozens of civilians killed, including several in a Basra housing estate. But each air raid was merely \"nibbed\" in our newspapers – a nib is a single paragraph in an inside-page News in Brief column – so that an entire air campaign was effectively carried out behind the backs of the US and British public in the years before the 2003 invasion.\\n\\nIn southern Lebanon, the Israelis controlled for 28 years a torture prison at Khiam for insurgents and their families – women as well as men – and electricity was frequently used on inmates by Israel\\'s \"South Lebanon Army\" thugs. Amnesty, Human Rights Watch and the International Red Cross complained. But I will always remember the words of a Swiss Red Cross official when I asked him, within sight of Khiam, why the world did not condemn this dreadful place.'}, {'id': 255148, 'ended': False, 'length': 1024, 'text': \"Location information:\\n\\n\\nhttp://sandiegolan.enjin.com/forum/m/12146438/viewthread/6268033-lan-parties-at-brians-house\\n\\n\\nGames we are most likely to play:\\n\\n\\nGames you would have to already own to play:\\n\\n\\nThe War Z (http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/226700/) / h1z1 (http://store.steampowered.com/app/295110/) / DayZ (http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/221100/) - Less Likely\\n\\nBattlefield 2 (http://store.steampowered.com/app/24860/)/3 (https://www.origin.com/en-us/store/buy/battlefield-3/pc-download/base-game/standard-edition?utm_campaign=origin-search-us-pbm-g-bf3-p&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_term=battlefield%203&sourceid=origin-search-us-pbm-g-bf3-p)/4 (http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield-4) - Likely\\n\\nLeft for dead 2 (http://store.steampowered.com/app/550/) - Likely\\n\\nSupreme Commander 2 (http://store.steampowered.com/app/40100/) - Less Likely\\n\\nCompany of Heroes (http://www.companyofheroes.com/en_us/) 1/2 - Less Likely\\n\\nMinecraft (https://minecraft.net/) - Less Likely\\n\\nTitanfall (https://www.origin.com/en-us/store/buy/titanfall/pc-download/base-game/standard-edition) - Less Likley\\n\\nRocket League (http://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/) - Likley\\n\\n\\nFree Games:\\n\\n\\nWorld Of tanks (http://worldoftanks.com/) - Likely\\n\\nTeam Fortress 2 (http://store.steampowered.com/app/440/) - Likely\\n\\nLeague of Legends (http://na.leagueoflegends.com/) - Must play with the rest of the LAN\\n\\nPlanetside 2 (https://www.planetside2.com/register) - Less Likely\\n\\nWar Thunder (http://warthunder.com/us/registration?r=SEM_AW1946291420_KW000652244&gclid=CKu_xc2zkcMCFUdefgodCj0APg) - Likely\\n\\nTribes (http://www.sandiegolan.net/ftp/tribes.zip) - Less Likely\\n\\n\\nGames we have extra copies of / loaner copies:\\n\\n\\nSupreme Commander - Forged alliance (http://store.steampowered.com/app/9420/) - Likley\\n\\nDemigod (http://store.steampowered.com/app/202710/) (League of Legends / DoTa clone) - Less Likely\\n\\nBlur (http://www.gamestop.com/pc/games/blur/75076) - Likely\\n\\nUnreal Tournament 3 (http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/13210/) - Less Likely\\n\\nGhost Recon (http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/15300/) - Less Likely\\n\\nJedi Knight - Jedi Academy (http://store.steampowered.com/app/6020/) - Likely\\n\\nCall of Duty - Modern Warfare 1 (COD4) (http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/7940/) - Likely\\n\\nCall of Duty - World @ War (http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/10090/) - Likely\\n\\nHalo (http://www.amazon.com/Halo-Combat-Evolved-PC/dp/B00009TW6R) - Likely\\n\\nArtemis Bridge Simulator (http://store.steampowered.com/app/247350/)- Likely\\n\\nStar Wars Battlefront II (http://store.steampowered.com/app/6060/) - Likely\\n\\nRed Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge (https://www.origin.com/en-us/store/buy/c-c-the-ultimate-collection/pc-download/bundle/ultimate-collection) - Likely\\n\\nQuake 3 Arena (http://store.steampowered.com/app/2200/) - Less Likely\\n\\n\\nNewcomers welcome - we are very friendly\"}, {'id': 255149, 'ended': True, 'length': 363, 'text': 'Coors Light Truck Hits Cyclist in Cambridge\\n\\nThe cyclist suffered leg injuries but no head injuries, according to police.\\n\\nGet a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning — great with coffee!\\n\\nA Coors Light truck struck a bicyclist this morning in Cambridge near the corner of Massachusetts Ave. and Sidney Street.

However, it\\'s also been almost as long since they\\'ve beaten their next opponent. The Timberwolves will attempt to snap a 15-game skid to the Los Angeles Lakers by taking advantage of their struggles on the road Sunday night. For the third time this season, Minnesota (9-10) is close to evening its record. In the most recent attempt, the Timberwolves were 7-8 before a 108-98 loss at Utah on Jan. 21 but have gotten another chance after two wins over teams from the Lone Star State. After a 105-90 victory in Dallas on Wednesday, they topped San Antonio 87-79 on Friday when Ricky Rubio scored nine of his 18 points in the fourth quarter. Kevin Love also had 18 points in his first home game after signing a four-year extension worth more than $60 million, and was one of three Minnesota players to record double-doubles along with Rubio and center Nikola Pekovic. \"It\\'s a terrific win for our guys,\" coach Rick Adelman said. \"Hopefully it\\'s really a step forward for us.\" Minnesota will try to use take another step by improving to .500 after 20 games for the first time since it was 22-22 on Jan. 30, 2007, and by beating the Lakers for the first time since March 6, 2007. The 15 consecutive losses to Los Angeles (11-9) since that 117-107 double overtime victory at home is the league\\'s second-longest active losing streak to one opponent. Minnesota has dropped 16 in a row to Northwest Division rival Portland. The Timberwolves, though, might have one of their best chances to snap that skid as the Lakers are 1-7 away from home. They opened a road-heavy stretch Saturday with a 100-89 loss in Milwaukee. A Kobe Bryant jumper put Los Angeles within four points of the Bucks with 4:52 remaining, but Milwaukee responded with a 15-4 run. The Lakers, who are playing seven of their next eight on the road, are off to their worst start on the road since dropping eight of their first nine in 2002-03. They\\'re also seeking to avoid their first five-game road losing streak since March 4-15, 2007. \"There\\'s concern and determination that we want to fix things. If we solve that issue, then we\\'ll be all right,\" Bryant said after his team lost for the fourth time in five games overall. Los Angeles can help itself by scoring 100 or more points for the first time in 14 games. The Lakers, winners of seven in a row at the Target Center, haven\\'t surpassed 96 in any of their eight road contests. They\\'re averaging 89.6 points away from home but have topped the century mark in seven of their last nine in Minnesota. This time, though, Los Angeles will face a Timberwolves team that\\'s made impressive strides defensively in its first season under Adelman. Minnesota is allowing 93.5 points per game after giving a league-worst 107.7 per contest in 2010-11. The Timberwolves, though, could use more help from Love against the Lakers. The California native has averaged 12.2 points in 11 all-time matchups, his lowest against a Western Conference opponent.

Just when it looked as though the Lakers were going to let another road game slip away, Kobe Bryant showed these young pups just how it\\'s done in closing time. Bryant had 35 points and 14 rebounds and Pau Gasol scored 28 to give the Lakers a much-needed road victory, 106-101 over the Timberwolves on Sunday night.

Tomaso Aste of the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies at the University College London\\'s Department of Computer Science thinks the current cost large and wasteful, but nonetheless, fair. Aste recently examined the factors that determine the current proof of work cost in a study titled \"The fair cost of Bitcoin proof of work.\"\\n\\nAste noted that bitcoin has proven that untrustful peers can exchange value over the Internet without any third party intermediary or trusted authority, as bitcoin has surpassed $10 billion in capitalization and processes tens of thousands of daily transactions with any serious challenge of attack.\\n\\nComputationally Intensive Process\\n\\nThe verification and cryptographic sealing mechanism that is critical to the bitcoin network involves a computationally intensive process. A large number of nodes in the bitcoin network engage in the verification process.\\n\\nThe process provides a mechanism that avoids false duplications of voters and forces voters to demonstrate computational capacity. To secure a qualified majority, the system employs a cryptographic sealing process that is computationally intensive. The process includes a challenge called \"proof of work.\" The first node that solves this challenge receives a bitcoin reward. This mechanism, called \"mining,\" enables new bitcoins to be created.\\n\\nMiners worldwide generate several billions hashes (10^18 or one Exahash) every second. With existing hardware, the computation of a billion hashes consumes between 0.1 to 1 Joule of energy. Hence, roughly a billion watts (1GW/sec) are used globally every second to create a valid proof of work.\\n\\nThe amount of energy for this process accounts for about $50,000 per hour, although electricity costs change worldwide.\\n\\nMiner Reward: 12.5 Bitcoins\\n\\nSince the system currently processes under 10,000 transactions hourly, the per-transaction cost exceeds $5. The user does not pay the cost. The miners pay the cost and are rewarded with the accreditation of new bitcoins.\\n\\nThe individual proof of work reward was 25 bitcoins leading up to the halving, equating to about $15,000 at current change.\\n\\nThe mining community is estimated to consume an average of around $50,000/6, equaling $8,333 in electricity every 10 minutes to create a block, receiving around $15,000 in remuneration. This makes the mining operation profitable, even taking into account the infrastructure and hardware cost.\\n\\nThe electricity cost for one year of mining totals more than $400 million. This can be viewed as a significant waste.\\n\\nThe reward, now cut in half to 12.5 bitcoins, will leave smaller profit margins, Aste noted.\\n\\nProof Of Work Benefits\\n\\nProof of work allows the blockchain to remain \"pure\" and lets an entire community compete to verify the validity of transactions and make attacks to the system costly.\\n\\nIs the cost justified? Aste claims the cost should make a double spending attack too expensive to be executed.\\n\\nA double spending attack would occur when someone tries to gain more bitcoin by spending the same bitcoin with different users. The attacker would attempt to double spend the highest amount of bitcoin possible. The amount is limited to that which is normally exchanged within a block, which is currently about $1 million.\\n\\nA transaction that includes a higher sum than the total transaction value in a block will attract attention from the network. This reality limits double spending to about $1 million. While the duplication can be repeated serially or in parallel several times, it does not affect the present computation\\'s outcomes.\\n\\nProtection From Attacks\\n\\nThe attacker can try to gain a fraction of $1 million. To do so, the attacker has to be sure both the duplicated transactions are validated. This requires a fork with two blocks attached to the previous block.\\n\\nIf the attacker has sufficient computing power, it is possible to generate two valid hashes to seal both blocks to create the impression that both transactions were verified. For a final transaction settlement, it is necessary to wait for six new blocks to join the blockchain to ensure the transaction is unlikely to be reverted.\\n\\nThe attacker has to generate six valid hashes before the double spend transaction can be considered settled. The attacker only has to artificially validate one of the two forks, the shortest. The system will consider the other to be valid and let to propagate by other miners. The attacker can propagate it as well.\\n\\nIt is unrealistic to assume no one will notice the propagating fork, Aste noted, but this assumption is made for the purpose of this hypothesis.\\n\\nAlso read: How proof of work…works\\n\\nHow Attacks Are Discouraged\\n\\nThe fork\\'s artificial propagation cost is the proof of work cost times six. The attacker will profit if the cost is less than the gain. The break-even point is represented by the following equation: the fair equilibrium cost of proof of work equals the duplicated fraction of the value of a block divided by the number'}, {'id': 255161, 'ended': True, 'length': 409, 'text': 'While 13,255 refugees were admitted in August, that number plunged to just 2,070 in March.

My initial San Diego experience was at a very impressionable time in my life.\\n\\n\\nI only \"liked\" professional baseball and football, but the San Diego community (and local teams) only enhanced that \"like\" and grew it into a love. I quickly grew into a diehard San Diego Padres (and Chargers) fan and I have been a fanatic of those two teams for the last 22 years. Tony Gwynn was the superstar for the Padres and he became my favorite baseball player the more and more I watched and listen to him.\\n\\n\\nLiving in San Diego, I went to as many baseball games as I could. Back in my early twenties, the Padres played at Jack Murphy Stadium, and the cheap tickets in right field were only $7 (back when baseball was considered the affordable sport), so we went to a lot of games. The best games were the Dodger/Padres of course, and Tony Gwynn always showed up and played great. Back then the Padres and Tony Gwynn were known as The Dodger Killers, as they always managed to beat their biggest rival L.A (the Giants on the other hand were quite opposite). It was Tony Gwynn\\'s team for 20 years and San Diegans loved their perennial all-star. No matter how terrible the Padres were, San Diego always had Tony Gwynn…\\n\\n\\nIn the 2001 season, the last season of Gwynn\\'s career, was my most remembered of him. How he lasted on the same team his whole career made me admire him more, as he taught sacrifice. Tony did not start that season, as he had a knee injury and he was primarily used as a pinch-hitter. Most Padres fans knew it was going to be Gwynn\\'s final season, and since he did not start that season, it made attending every game even more important (just so you can get that final glimpse of the Mr. San Diego legend). As most pinch-hitters are used, in the latter innings of close games, fans would be anxious (at a warm idle) in hope the Padres could get a runner in scoring position, then Padres fans could \"possibly\" see Tony Gwynn come in for a pinch-hit. I got to see one of those close games, might have been his last too, and Tony hit a pinch hit single, drove in the winning run and the crowd went haywire.\\n\\n\\nI think the older we get, the more emotional we get, or we can actually recognize what we can lose even more (especially when we can relate our own experiences with those reminders of our past). The story of my favorite baseball player had so many chapters of Tony Gwynn\\'s 20 year career, with each year (or Chapter) being so different. From a young kid and growing into the man I am today, I can feel and empathize what Tony Gwynn did then, and related it to me, and what I was doing then. Being just a fan of a guy lets me combine his career and achievements, to where I\\'ve been in my own life.\\n\\n\\nI was always a fan of Tony Gwynn (the player, the person, the coach and the broadcaster). These \"links\" of history that we tie with the players we admire the most helps us look at ourselves (by reminding us of our own past and where we are now). I was only a fan of Tony Gwynn and I never met him, but he was Mr. San Diego and everyone in San Diego (and beyond) loved him. The moments of Tony Gwynn\\'s career are joined and bonded together through my life, as well as other fans across the globe. Remembering what he did makes me think of where I was, when he did it. When I was 20, 30 and 40 years old, Tony Gwynn\\'s career accomplishments remind me of several moment of my own life. When Tony Gwynn spoke, people were drawn to him. Aside his baseball accomplishments; his gift of gab, his charisma, and his smile were mesmerizing and he will truly be immortalize in my heart and with all baseball fans alike.\\n\\n\\nTony Gwynn, Mr. San Diego, died today from cancer. He was 54 years old.\\n\\n\\nAdvertisements'}, {'id': 255163, 'ended': False, 'length': 1024, 'text': 'Django or Drupal for Content Management: Which Fits your Needs?

Consumers have long chafed at having to pay for set-top boxes to get a cable signal.\\n\\n\"If adopted, consumers will no longer have to rent a set-top box, month after month,\" Wheeler wrote. \"Instead, pay-TV providers will be required to provide apps -- free of charge -- that consumers can download to the device of their choosing to access all the programming and features they already paid for.\"\\n\\nWheeler\\'s proposal comes six months after the Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 along party lines to begin crafting rules intended to spur competition in the set-top box market by developing technology standards so that third-party devices and apps could decode pay-TV signals.\\n\\nSuch a service would enable consumers to watch cable channels over on an Internet-connected television or device such as an Xbox, Roku or AppleTV.\\n\\nCable and satellite companies collect a combined $20 billion annually in rental fees, adding to the overall cost of cable or satellite service. Wheeler cited an analysis that said consumers pay an average of $231 annually for the use of a box.\\n\\nWheeler\\'s plan was praised by consumer groups but met with strong criticism by the cable industry. The companies and their trade group, the NationalCable and Telecommunications Assocation, characterized Wheeler\\'s plan as an act of government overreach that goes beyond the FCC\\'s authority.\\n\\n\"This proposal would far exceed the Commission\\'s legal authority and improperly insert the government into private contract negotiations between payTV distributors, content creators and device manufacturers,\" the NCTA said in a statement.\\n\\nWheeler, who has long been an advocate of bringing down the cost of video service to consumers, said studies have shown that 84 percent of consumers believe their cable bill is too high. About 99 percent of the nation\\'s 100 million pay-TV subscribers rent at least one set-top box.\\n\\n\"We keep paying these charges even after the cost of the box has been recovered because we have no meaningful alternative,\" he said.\\n\\nWheeler also believes the industry needs to adapt to the technological changes that have already upended the television industry through the increased number of programming choices they have provided. A rapidly growing number of consumers, especially in the 18 to 34 age group, are turning to online streaming for their video content and want more options through Internet platforms.\\n\\n\"This proposal is an important step in giving consumers new, innovative choices in a market that\\'s had limited -- if any -- competition for years,\" Consumers Union said in a statement.\\n\\nWheeler\\'s plan gives large pay TV providers, such as Comcast and DirecTV, two years to offer streaming apps to their customers. Medium-sized companies would have an additional two years while smaller providers would be exempt.\\n\\nAbout 90 percent of cable and satellite customers are served by the companies that will have to adopt the service in two years.\\n\\nCable companies already have the technology that offers their channels through apps, but the rental of a set-top box is required.\\n\\nOpposition from the cable industry, which has been anticipating Wheeler\\'s move, came quickly after his official announcement. Comcast, the largestcable provider in the U.S., said the proposed regulation would hurt the technological development of apps.\\n\\n\"Heavy-handed government technology mandates have a long history of failure,\" the company said in a statement. \"The Chairman\\'s approach would likely meet the same fate, while causing real damage to the thriving apps marketplace and real harm to consumers.\"\\n\\nCharter Communications called Wheeler\\'s plan \"a valid goal,\" but argued the marketplace is already meeting consumer demand for apps that provide video service. \"The FCC\\'s mandate threatens to bog down with regulations and bureaucracy the entire TV app market that consumers are increasingly looking to for innovation, choice and competition,\" the company said in a statement.\\n\\nIt\\'s not clear whether Wheeler\\'s proposal will be approved by the FCC.

Shopping for the different cuts of meat can be difficult sometimes, especially if you don't know the nutritional value of the beef. In this section, we will show you the following:\\n\\nMost American cattle breeds are descendents of animals imported, possibly by the Vikings, during the early 1000s. Columbus and other early explorers also brought cattle on board their ships. Today, over 100 million head of cattle live in the United States and Canada. Beef is available in many different cuts, including steaks, roasts, brisket, stew meat, and ground beef. Tender cuts come from the ribs and loin. Tougher cuts come from the rump and shoulder. Prime beef has thin layers of fat, called marbling, running visibly through the muscle. Choice beef has little or no marbling but a layer of pinkish fat on the outer edges.\\n\\nThe Importance Of Beef\\n\\nMany of us are trying to eat healthily. We are adding more whole grains and fresh vegetables to our diets, and eating less saturated fat. Beef is part of a healthy diet. Beef makes a meal filling, satisfying, and festive. Think back to the wonderful standing rib roasts of Christmas past, those made-to-order steaks for the annual 4th of July barbecue, or mom's famous spaghetti and meatball special. Beef is what makes the meal memorable. You can still enjoy these classics. Remember, while red meat does contain a fair amount of fat, it is also a concentrated source of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Eaten in moderation, it can be a part of a well balanced diet.\\n\\nBeef is divided into primal cuts. From these larger sections, your butcher makes smaller cuts suitable for individual or family size portions. Different cuts require different treatment. For instance, chuck makes an excellent roast, but will be tough and chewy if pan-broiled. With this in mind, we have prepared this handy chart. The following is by no means an exhaustive list of the possible divisions of each section, but will give you some idea of the special characteristics and uses of each area. Besides being a simple anatomy lesson, it will help you make sense of that long meat counter.\\n\\nNutritional Breakdowns - Which Cut Is Best?\\n\\nEach cut has a different amount of calories, protein and fat. As a bodybuilder, the choice you make can make a big difference. Check out the table below.

If you have not read the book, and don\\'t wish to know how it all ends, please bookmark this page and save it until you\\'re ready to read! Prior to Andres Muscheitti\\'s film, there were a few reasons why Stephen King\\'s IT was considered unadaptable in the medium, and only one of them was the extreme length of the story. Another is the fact that the end of the book winds up getting extremely trippy and weird in its third act, with both the kids and adults\\' storylines leading to confrontation with the titular monster on an inter-dimensional battlefield. Obviously this element was entirely left out of the recently released movie, but star Bill Skarsgard really wants to see IT: Chapter 2 fully embrace it. Discussing the nature and mind of Pennywise in the novel, he recently said, It\\'s hardly answered in the novel, either. I mean, it\\'s very abstract. And I kind of like that. It could be almost a sort of surrealistic sort of psychedelic trip if you go into the mind of Pennywise. And if you\\'ve read the novel you know that they do actually go into his mind. Or they go into this trans-dimensional place, and they sort of beat him in this place. Which might be interesting, what that place would be, and what would it look like. There\\'s opportunities, I think, and I\\'m excited for it. Bill Skarsgard is currently promoting his second Stephen King adaptation of 2017, the new Hulu series Castle Rock, but while speaking with IGN at New York Comic-Con this past weekend he also took the time to talk about what he would like to see in IT: Chapter 2. The actor was asked about the possibility of the sequel delving deeper into his monstrous character\\'s mind, and Skarsgard noted that he thinks there are some fantastic visual opportunities to explore with that idea in the source material. In the novel, there are a couple chapters that dive into the nature of Pennywise, and it\\'s revealed that he is an ancient, interdimensional entity who feeds on fear for sustenance so that he can last through his 27-year hibernation periods. Defeating IT requires the fight being brought to ITs own home turf - in a \"ceremony\" called The Ritual of Chud - and how it\\'s described in the book would be a sincere challenge to directly adapt on screen. The Losers Club performs the Ritual of Chud when they are both children and adults, but just because it wasn\\'t featured in Andres Muschietti\\'s IT doesn\\'t mean that it won\\'t wind up in IT: Chapter 2. In fact, Bill Skarsgard argues that the sequel actually should be a very different film, as what scares children and what scares adults are two very different things, and that deserves exploration. Said Skarsgard, The first movie worked so well at what it is trying to do, I think, and ultimately that is the kids\\' story, and you follow these kids and you sort of fall in love with these kids. And the second one will be the adult story. And I think the right way to do it is to make that movie actively different. ... I think there might be worth exploring sort of the psychological aspects of horror, but also maybe the sort of cosmological existence of this being. What is he, and where does he come from?

The official magazine of Dravidian movement proclaimed on 28-09-1955: \"If we are to lynch the Aryans in the middle of the roads in broad day light all day long, today none shall care to question that\". However, in reality that was not the case. The Tamil Nadu government, then led by K Kamaraj as chief minister, did not hesitate to take action against Dravidian propaganda demeaning the sacred thread.\\n\\nSubsequently, the cultural reality and strains of real politics made even Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) refrain from rabid anti-Brahmin rhetoric. In 1955, C N Annadurai, who later became chief minister, explained that if they could destroy caste system by destroying Brahmins – the same way Hitler did with the Jews – it would be \"sensible to an extent\". But, he explained that the caste system, which he described as \\'Aryanism\\' had become a part of Tamil society at large, and hence they had to resort to campaigning without violent means.\\n\\nDeep down they had strong hatred for Hinduism, which despite all social stigmas, still provided a democratic religious system, and hence it was an obstacle to their totalitarian ideologies and theologies. So, anti-Brahminism is aimed not just at Brahmins, but its ultimate aim is to destroy Hinduism and Hindu communities. Naturally, institutional and anti-Brahmin political movements get support from Christian and Islamic expansionist forces.\\n\\nIn 1950s, a bishop from Madurai, in his book on church and Dravidian movement, called the movement a time bomb that they have developed to destroy Hinduism. In 2017, Mathimaran, a rabid anti-Hindu Dravidianist, who calls Subramania Bharati a \\'Brahmin-Hindu supremacist\\' is a guest in Christian institutions. The remarkable consistency in supporting the worst forms of anti-Hindu racial hate ideologies by Christian institutions is telling.\\n\\nSoon after Tony Joseph wrote a distorted report in The Hindu on the Aryan invasion and migration question as being settled through genetics in favour of the invasion/migration hypothesis, WhatsApp messages started spreading in many groups.

Rebekah Rousi hung around two tall office towers in town, riding elevators up and down day after day, looking for patterns. When a bunch of people get into an elevator, she wondered, do they segregate in any predictable way? Do tall ones stand in the back? Do men stand in different places than women? Who looks where? She says she wasn\\'t expecting or even predicting a particular configuration, but she found one.\\n\\nOver and over, she noticed that older \"more senior men in particular seem to direct themselves towards the back of the elevator cabins.\"\\n\\nYounger men took up the middle ground.\\n\\nAnd in the front, facing the doors, backs to the guys, stood \"women of all ages.\"\\n\\nShe\\'s not sure why. It wasn\\'t segregation by height. It wasn\\'t age, since older and younger women co-mingled. Clearly, the people in the back had the advantage of seeing everybody in the cabin, while people in the front had no idea who was behind them. Could there be a curiosity difference? A predatory difference?\\n\\nThere was a second pattern, one that broke along gender lines. \"Men,\" she wrote, \"looked in the side mirrors and the door mirrors\" to openly check out the other passengers, and/or themselves.\\n\\nWomen didn\\'t do that. \"Women would watch the monitors and avoid eye contact with other users (unless in conversation).\" They would only look at the mirrors (where they could check out the other passengers) when they were with other women. Eye-wise, the guys were roving, the ladies weren\\'t.\\n\\n\"That\\'s where I started thinking of power,\" Rebekah wrote me. The men who flocked to the back, who had a better view of their fellow passengers, were consistently older, more \"senior\" (I\\'m not sure how she knew that, but it\\'s in her posted paper) and many of them \"weren\\'t concerned with \\'getting caught\\' looking in the mirror.\" They gazed freely, suggesting a sense of privilege. Younger, less powerful men seemed to avoid that space, choosing a middle ground. The back of the box, (unlike the back of the bus in Alabama civil rights days) she decided, might be the elevator power zone.\\n\\nOr ...\\n\\nPerhaps a gender analysis is too easy. Power hierarchies in elevators, she wrote, \"almost seemed too cliché.\" This could be about shyness. Bold people choose the back; shy people the front. Does that mean she thinks Australian women are more self-conscious than Australian men? She wouldn\\'t go there, except to say, \"I don\\'t really want people to know how vain I am, so looking in the mirror (as a woman or not) when others are in the lift ... is highly avoided.\" By this analysis, the back of the elevator is the Vanity-Unleashed zone.\\n\\nBasically, she\\'s still puzzled. A pattern shows up. But the explanation, she said, slipping into academic shyness, \"awaits further analysis.\" Then she added, \"I\\'d be really interested to hear what your listeners (she means you, you reading this) have to say about the issue.\"\\n\\nThe always mischievous Latif Nasser (who is, I should mention, a regular contributor to Radiolab) read this post and sent me a video that describes a very different kind of elevator behavior.

It revealed a 6% drop in annual emissions for the entire economy from 2008 to 2009, but does not directly show the extent of pollution from the oilsands production, which is greater than the greenhouse gas emissions of all the cars driven on Canadian roads.\\n\\nThe data also indicated that emissions per barrel of oil produced by the sector is increasing, despite claims made by the industry in an advertising campaign.\\n\\n\"The oilsands remain Canada\\'s fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas pollution, and they\\'re the subject of a huge amount of attention and scrutiny in Canada and internationally,\" said Clare Demerse, director of climate change at the Pembina Institute, an Alberta-based environmental research group. \"So it\\'s very disappointing to see Environment Canada publish a 500-page report that leaves out these critical numbers — especially when last year\\'s edition included them.\"\\n\\nOverall, Environment Canada said that the oilsands industry was responsible for about 6.5% of Canada\\'s annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2009, up from 5% in 2008. This also indicates a growth in emissions that is close to about 300% since 1990, which cancel out many reductions in pollution from other economic sectors.\\n\\nThe report attributes the 6% decrease in Canada\\'s overall emissions to the economic slowdown, but it also credits efforts by the Ontario government to reduce production of coal-fired electricity as a significant factor.\\n\\nEnvironment Canada provided the oilsands numbers in response to questions from Postmedia News about why it had omitted the information from its report after publishing more detailed data in previous years. A department spokesman explained that \"some\" of the information was still available in the latest report, which still meets Canada\\'s reporting obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.\\n\\n\"The information is presented in this way to be consistent with UNFCCC reporting requirements, which are divided into broad, international sectors,\" wrote Mark Johnson in an email.\\n\\nHe was not immediately able to answer questions about who made the decision in government to exclude the numbers from the oilsands or provide a detailed explanation about changes in emissions.\\n\\nAn industry spokesman said it favoured more transparency from the government, suggesting that some of the figures may be misleading because of changes in methods used to identify and calculate emissions.\\n\\n\"It\\'s just too bad you weren\\'t able to get a hold of (Environment Canada) on this one, because here I am telling you my understanding of what\\'s going on, but really it\\'s best to hear directly from them,\" said Greg Stringham, vice-president of oilsands and markets at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. \"We report the information to them, and they choose to pass it on — they must pass it on the UN. But then they choose how to disclose it and put it out there.\"\\n\\nAlthough Stringham said that the industry figures did not show any significant growth in emissions per barrel of oil produced, the full report noted an intensity increase of 14.5% from 2008 to 2009, \"mainly the result of a new integrated mining and upgrading facility as well as a new integrated in-situ bitumen extraction and upgrading facility,\" that were not operating at \"peak efficiencies.\"\\n\\nEmissions from a mining category, which includes oilsands extraction, saw a 371% increase in greenhouse gas pollution, according to the report. But other categories showed significant decreases due, in part, to the recession, but also because of changes in use of fuel and manufacturing operations.\\n\\nEnvironment Canada\\'s report recognizes that climate change is occurring, mainly due to an increase in heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. The objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize these emissions in order to prevent dangerous changes to the climate.\\n\\nCritics have suggested the Harper government is deliberately trying to delay international action to fight climate change, following revelations, reported last fall by Postmedia News, that it had set up a partnership with the Alberta government, industry and several federal departments to fight pollution-reduction policies from other countries that target the oilsands through lobbying and public relations.\\n\\nEnvironment Minister Peter Kent has said the federal government is committed to reducing Canada\\'s greenhouse gas emissions and will introduce its plan to regulate pollution from the oilsands within months. But he has also acknowledged that existing federal and provincial policies would still result in an increase in emissions over the next decade.\\n\\nAlthough the report was due in April, during the last election campaign, Canada was the last country to file its submission. Environment Canada even filed its submission after earthquake-stricken Japan, and was unable to explain in detail why its report was late.'}, {'id': 255182, 'ended': True, 'length': 372, 'text': \"The Underground Reservoir is a watery underground location in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow.

Two additional entities, Dune Entertainment International and Dune Entertainment LP, held in total nearly $62 million in gross asset value.

It is, he said, a difficult thing the county asked you to do, and it is grateful. Then he –\\n\\nOh, wait, sorry. I left out the crime. It was ugly. Edgar Allen Poe stuff. Hoffner and his co-defendant Archie Dixon wanted to get hold of their buddy Chris Hammer's car. So they, with the assistance of Kristen Wilkerson (Dixon's girlfriend) . . . Feh. Don't make me tell it. Here's the official version, from the Ohio Supreme Court's opinion in Hoffner's appeal.\\n\\nIn the early morning of September 22, Hoffner, Dixon, and Hammer went to Wilkerson's house. Once there, Hoffner and Dixon attacked Hammer. Hoffner restrained Hammer in a headlock while Dixon beat him. Hoffner tried to break Hammer's neck, and Dixon struck Hammer in the head with a wine bottle. Hoffner and Dixon then tied Hammer to a bunk-bed ladder, and Dixon went through Hammer's wallet, taking out his money, birth certificate, and Social Security card. Then Hoffner and Dixon discussed how they should dispose of Hammer's body. While Hammer remained tied to the bunk-bed ladder, Hoffner and Dixon left Wilkerson's house to dig a grave. Hoffner and Dixon returned to Wilkerson's house and they, along with Wilkerson, drove Hammer, blindfolded, to the gravesite in Hammer's car. Wilkerson stayed at the car while Hoffner and Dixon walked Hammer into the woods, where they permitted Hammer to smoke a cigarette. Then they gagged and again blindfolded Hammer, tied his hands and feet behind his back, grabbed him by his arms and legs, and dropped him into the grave, still alive. At one point, Hammer was able to remove the gag from his mouth and free one of his legs. Hoffner jumped into the grave and placed his foot over Hammer's mouth when Hammer yelled for help. Hoffner and Dixon then held Hammer down and covered him with dirt. After Hammer was completely buried, Hoffner and Dixon walked back and forth across the grave, packing down the dirt. Hoffner, Dixon, and Wilkerson then returned to Wilkerson's house in Hammer's car.\\n\\nOK, got that? Now, let's start again.\\n\\nThe jury returned its verdict recommending that Tim Hoffner be executed, that he should be killed in the name of the people of the State of Ohio. And the judge, as judges pretty much all do after any jury trial, thanked them for their service. It is, he said, a difficult thing the county asked you to do, but a vitally important thing.\\n\\nThen he added that if any of the jurors needed therapy as a result of performing this service, the county would pay for it.\\n\\nThere were three executions scheduled for last week.\\n\\nKelly Gissendaner, on death row in Georgia, didn't kill anyone herself though she arranged for the 1997 murder of her husband, Douglas Gissander. Gregory Owen, the actual killer, was her lover at the time. He's doing life with a chance of parole. Whatever, whoever Gissendaner was then, she'd changed, showed remorse, provided support and counsel for other prisoners.\\n\\nRichard Glossip, on death row in Oklahoma, didn't kill anyone, either. It was Justin Sneed, serving a life sentence for the crime, who murdered Barry Van Treese, the owner of the motel where they both worked. The state's theory is that Glossip put Sneed up to it. The evidence supporting that claim, never strong, has pretty much completely unraveled.\\n\\nIt's pretty clear that Alfredo Prieto, on death row in Virginia, did kill people himself, at least three and maybe half a dozen more that he's been linked to. He was on death row in California for the 1990 rape and murder of Yvette Woodruff when DNA tied him to killings in Virginia. He was extradited there, tried and again sentenced to be killed for the 1988 murders of Rachel Raver and Warren Fulton, III.[1] There's a fair chance that Prieto was mentally retarded. If so, his execution would be unconstitutional. The courts showed no interest in finding out.\\n\\nGissendaner was to be executed Tuesday, Glossip Wednesday, Prieto Thursday. In each case the Pope, who'd made a point of calling for abolition of the death penalty when he spoke to Congress, made a specific request that the sentence be commuted. None of the sentences were.\\n\\nIn each case, last minute litigation raised questions about what would happen. None of it staved off the executions.

(AP Photo/Dawn Villella, file) (Photo: Dawn Villella, AP) Story Highlights Current Michigan law would allow for a wolf hunt in 2015.\\n\\nProposals 14-1 and 14-2 will have no authority unless current law overturned via legal challenges.\\n\\nThere will be no Michigan wolf hunt in 2014.\\n\\nMichigan voters who care whether the state should allow wolf hunting can have their say next week on the general election ballot.\\n\\nSort of.\\n\\nTwo proposals are on the Nov. 4 ballot that would either allow or prohibit state officials from holding another public hunting season for wolves. However, both proposals are essentially null and void -- regardless of how Michiganders vote on them -- because of action taken by the Legislature over the summer.\\n\\nAdvocates on both sides of the issue want voters to have their say because the proposals could become important in the future.\\n\\nThe proposals are the result of a complicated political chess match between those who oppose public wolf hunting and those who think it\\'s an important tool for managing the former endangered species.\\n\\nTo help you understand what you\\'re voting on, we talked to the non-partisan Citizens Research Council to put together a primer on both proposals and why they may not matter until the future.\\n\\nThe history\\n\\nFirst, Wolves are native to Michigan but were nearly wiped out in the 19th and early 20th centuries by hunting and state-sanctioned bounties.\\n\\nIn 1973, when Congress created the federal endangered species list, only six wolves were known to still exist in the Michigan wild.\\n\\nUnder federal protection, wolf recovery was slow. But starting in 1989, the numbers began to rise in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin, along with the hope that one day the animals would rebound enough to return to state control.\\n\\nTo prepare for that possibility, the state convened a task force in 2005 to create a wolf management plan. Members of the task force included all stakeholders in wolf management, including biologists, representatives of Michigan\\'s Indian tribes, sporting groups and wolf advocates.\\n\\nAn overview of wolves in Michigan\\n\\nBy 2007, the wolf population in the Upper Peninsula topped 500 -- far exceeding the recovery benchmark of 100 set by the federal government, making the Great Lakes gray wolf one of the most successful recovery stories in the history of the endangered species list.\\n\\nAt the same time, however, some Upper Peninsula residents began to complain that wolves were edging too close for comfort. Some farmers reported that wolves were killing livestock, and U.P. citizens reported wolves encroaching on towns and yards.\\n\\nIn 2007, U.S. Fish and Wildlife sought to remove Great Lakes gray wolves from federal protection, but the Humane Society of the United States sued to delay the move. A federal court ruled in favor of the Humane Society, and wolves remained under endangered species protection for several more years.\\n\\nFinally, in 2012, Great Lakes gray wolves were removed from the endangered species list, putting the state of Michigan back in control of its wolf population.\\n\\nThe conversation - or the debate\\n\\nMichigan\\'s wolf management plan highlighted several methods for controlling the wolf population once they were removed from the endangered species list, including a potential public wolf hunt.\\n\\nRead the wolf management plan\\n\\nIn December 2012, less than a year after wolves were removed from the list, the Legislature passed a bill designating wolves game animals. It was signed by Gov. Rick Snyder and became Public Act 520.\\n\\nThe new law cleared the way for the Natural Resources Commission -- a seven-member body appointed by the governor -- to establish a hunting season for wolves.\\n\\nProponents, including the state Department of Natural Resources, cited several reasons for backing wolf hunts. The DNR told lawmakers at a hearing that hunting would be one of many tools used by wildlife officials to control the wolf population.\\n\\n\"While the wolf population offers benefits, it also poses significant costs and concerns to some Michigan residents,\" Trevor VanDyke, the DNR\\'s legislative liaison, told a Senate committee. \"This would be another tool that would allow for proper management and implementation of the wolf management plan, and we think we\\'d use this as a tool to reduce those negative impacts and conflicts with livestock and humans.\"\\n\\nOpponents believed it was too soon to talk about a hunt. At the same hearing, wolf advocate Nancy Warren of the National Wolfwatcher Coalition questioned the scientific need for hunting as a management tool.\\n\\n\"There is no scientific evidence or research to support the need for'}, {'id': 255192, 'ended': True, 'length': 186, 'text': \"Lambdas are now available within Java 8 in the form of JSR-335 - Lambda Expressions for the JavaTM Programming Language\\n\\nUPDATE: JDK8 has now been released which contains project lambda.

Every time I write an article or blog on wireless LAN security, someone has to come along and regurgitate one of these myths. If that weren\\'t bad enough, many \"so called\" security experts propagated these myths through speaking engagements and publications and many continue to this day. Many wireless LAN equipment makers continue to recommend many of these schemes to this day. One would think that the fact that none of these schemes made it in to the official IEEE 802.11i security standard would give a clue to their effectiveness, but time and time again that theory is proven wrong. To help you avoid the these schemes, I\\'ve created the following list of the six dumbest ways to secure your wireless LAN.\\n\\nWireless LAN security hall of shame\\n\\nMAC filtering: This is like handing a security guard a pad of paper with a list of names. Then when someone comes up to the door and wants entry, the security guard looks at the person\\'s name tag and compares it to his list of names and determines whether to open the door or not. Do you see a problem here? All someone needs to do is watch an authorized person go in and forge a name tag with that person\\'s name. The comparison to a wireless LAN here is that the name tag is the MAC address. The MAC address is just a 12 digit long HEX number that can be viewed in clear text with a sniffer. A sniffer to a hacker is like a hammer to a carpenter except the sniffer is free. Once the MAC address is seen in the clear, it takes about 10 seconds to cut-paste a legitimate MAC address in to the wireless Ethernet adapter settings and the whole scheme is defeated. MAC filtering is absolutely worthless since it is one of the easiest schemes to attack. The shocking thing is that so many large organizations still waste the time to implement these things. The bottom line is, MAC filtering takes the most effort to manage with zero ROI (return on investment) in terms of security gain.\\n\\nSSID hiding: There is no such thing as \"SSID hiding\". You\\'re only hiding SSID beaconing on the Access Point. There are 4 other mechanisms that also broadcast the SSID over the 2.4 or 5 GHz spectrum. The 4 mechanisms are; probe requests, probe responses, association requests, and re-association requests. Essentially, youre talking about hiding 1 of 5 SSID broadcast mechanisms. Nothing is hidden and all youve achieved is cause problems for Wi-Fi roaming when a client jumps from AP to AP. Hidden SSIDs also makes wireless LANs less user friendly. You dont need to take my word for it. Just ask Robert Moskowitz who is the Senior Technical Director of ICSA Labs in his white paper Debunking the myth of SSID hiding.\\n\\nLEAP authentication: The use of Cisco LEAP authentication continues to be the single biggest mistake that corporations make with their wireless LAN because they leave themselves wide open to attack. Cisco still tells their customers that LEAP is fine so long as strong passwords are used. The problem is that strong passwords are an impossibility for humans to deal with. If you doubt this, try a password audit of all the users in your organization and see how long it takes to crack 99% of all passwords. 99% of organizations will flunk any password audit for most of their users within hours. Any attempt to enforce strong passwords will result in passwords written on sticky notes. Since Joshua Wright released a toolthat can crackLEAP with lighting speed, Cisco was forced to come out with a better alternative to LEAP and they came up with an upgradeto LEAP calledEAP-FAST. Unfortunately, EAP-FAST still falls short in security with its default installation. Although Cisco makes LEAP and EAP-FAST freely available to partners for the client end, the same is not true for Access Points.LEAP and EAP-FAST are essentially two proprietary protocolsthat Cisco employs as a strategy to monopolize the Access Point market. There are open standards based EAP mechanisms like EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and PEAP which are all much more secure than either LEAP or EAP-FAST and they work on all Access Points and client adapters, not just Cisco. Cisco does support open standard EAPs just like everyone else so you should always use open EAP standards to get better security and avoid the hardware lock-in.\\n\\nDisable DHCP: This is much more of waste of time than it is a security break. DHCP allows the automatic assignment of IP addresses and other configurations. Disabling DHCP has zero security value and just wastes time. It would take a hacker about 10 seconds to figure out the IP scheme of any network and simply assign their own IP address.

He is LOVED by all, and he is a miraculous gift to our family and everyone else who knows him.On Monday, January 27th, Anthony received the devastating news that he has ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease. ALS runs in the family. His grandmother died from it, and his mother currently has it. Ironically, Anthony had been helping to take care of his mother and is a dedicated advocate and voice in the fight to cure ALS when this all happened. In his own words:\"During the past six months, my hands became noticeably weaker, and both arms began twitching constantly. My last few weddings, I had difficulties changing my camera settings, because my hands were so weak. I tried to convince myself it was carpal tunnel, even though I knew these were the same symptoms my mother and grandmother experienced before they were diagnosed with ALS. I finally got health insurance and was seen by a neurologist. I was diagnosed soon after.\"To attempt to preserve the muscle that\\'s left in his hands and arms, he can no longer work as a wedding photographer. The equipment is too heavy, and the days are too long. Once muscle is lost, it cannot be regained, and the risk is not worth it. He is liquidating his camera equipment to raise funds to pay for his medical insurance and costs, as well as his business expenses and taxes that he currently owes, but it will not be enough since he can no longer work...

Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. With voluntary muscle action progressively affected, patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed.

            "1. There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes. Profiler looks crispy, Fortier looks classic. Profiler plots are quite simple. Fortier's plot are far more complicated... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to spot similarities... The main character is weak and weirdo, but have \"clairvoyance\". People like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. How about just enjoying? Funny thing too, people writing Fortier looks American but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language, or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. The acting is not superficial at all...\n",
            "2. This movie is a great. The plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie starts of with a scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called \"when you stub your toe on the moon\" It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it is fun and inspirational. The Music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir \"Saggy\" Sagamore. OVerall a great family movie or even a great Date movie. This is a movie you can watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is gorgeous. I love this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Court Jester then you will definitely like this movie.\n",
            "3. George P. Cosmatos' \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\" is pure wish-fulfillment. The United States clearly didn't win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this. He is extremely patriotic, bemoans that US-Americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier, but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians. Like every film that defends the war (e.g. \"We Were Soldiers\") also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia. And for that matter also the reason for every single US-American soldier that was there. Instead, Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories, rather than suppressing them. \"Do we get to win this time?\" Yes, you do.\n",
            "4. In the process of trying to establish the audiences' empathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) the filmmakers slander the North and the Jayhawkers. Missouri never withdrew from the Union and the Union Army was not an invading force. The Southerners fought for State's Rights: the right to own slaves, elect crooked legislatures and judges, and employ a political spoils system. There's nothing noble in that. The Missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the Confederate Army.<br /><br />It seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves the Bushwhackers, it's not because he saw error in his way, he certainly doesn't give himself over to the virtue of the cause of abolition.\n",
            "5. Yeh, I know -- you're quivering with excitement. Well, *The Secret Lives of Dentists* will not upset your expectations: it's solidly made but essentially unimaginative, truthful but dull. It concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice (already a recipe for trouble: if it wasn't for our separate work-lives, we'd all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation). Campbell Scott, whose mustache and demeanor don't recall Everyman so much as Ned Flanders from *The Simpsons*, is the mild-mannered, uber-Dad husband, and Hope Davis is the bored-stiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera. One night, as Dad & the daughters attend one of Davis' performances, he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing: he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera. (One nice touch: we never see the opera-director's face.) Dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation, divorce, and custody hearings -- profitable only to the lawyers -- Scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wife's indiscretions.<br /><br />Already, the literate among you are starting to yawn: ho-hum, another story about the Pathetic, Sniveling Little Cuckold. But Rudolph, who took the story from a Jane Smiley novella, hopes that the wellworn-ness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy, postmodern touches. For instance, one of Scott's belligerent patients (Denis Leary, kept relatively -- and blessedly -- in check) will later become a sort of construction of the dentist's imagination, emerging as a Devil-on-the-shoulder advocate for the old-fashioned masculine virtues (\"Dump the b---h!\", etc.). When not egged-on by his imaginary new buddy, Scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a three-way with two of the male dental-assistants who work in their practice. It's not going too far to say that this movie is *Eyes Wide Shut* for Real People (or Grown-Ups, at least). Along those lines, Campbell Scott and Hope Davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of Cruise and Kidman. Further, the script for *Secret Lives* is clearly more relevant than Kubrick's. As proof, I offer the depiction of the dentists' children, particularly the youngest one who is about 3 or 4 years old, and whose main utterance is \"Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! DAD!!!\" This is Family Life, all right, with all its charms.<br /><br />The movie would make an interesting double-bill with *Kramer vs. Kramer*, as well. One can easily trace the Feminization of the American Male from 1979 to 2003. In this movie, Dad is the housewife as in *Kramer*, but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role, unlike Dustin Hoffman, who was too manly to make toast. Here, Scott gets all the plumb chores, such as wiping up the children's vomit, cooking, cleaning, taking the kids to whatever inane after-school activity is on the docket. And all without complaint. (And without directorial commentary. It's just taken for granted.)<br /><br />The film has virtues, mostly having to do with verisimilitude. However, it's dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions, which culminate in a long scene where a horrible five-day stomach flu makes the rounds in the household. We must endure pointless fantasy sequences, initiated by the imaginary ringleader Leary. Whose existence, by the way, is finally reminiscent of the Brad Pitt character in *Fight Club*. And this finally drives home the film's other big flaw: lack of originality. In this review, I realize it's been far too easy to reference many other films. Granted, this film is an improvement on most of them, but still. *The Secret Lives of Dentists* is worth seeing, but don't get too excited about it. (Not that you were all that excited, anyway. I guess.)\n"

            "1. <br /><br />When I unsuspectedly rented A Thousand Acres, I thought I was in for an entertaining King Lear story and of course Michelle Pfeiffer was in it, so what could go wrong?<br /><br />Very quickly, however, I realized that this story was about A Thousand Other Things besides just Acres. I started crying and couldn't stop until long after the movie ended. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn, for bringing us such a wonderfully subtle and compassionate movie! Thank you cast, for being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentleness!<br /><br />I recognized the Angry sister; the Runaway sister and the sister in Denial. I recognized the Abusive Husband and why he was there and then the Father, oh oh the Father... all superbly played. I also recognized myself and this movie was an eye-opener, a relief, a chance to face my OWN truth and finally doing something about it. I truly hope A Thousand Acres has had the same effect on some others out there.<br /><br />Since I didn't understand why the cover said the film was about sisters fighting over land -they weren't fighting each other at all- I watched it a second time. Then I was able to see that if one hadn't lived a similar story, one would easily miss the overwhelming undercurrent of dread and fear and the deep bond between the sisters that runs through it all. That is exactly the reason why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors for instance.<br /><br />But yet another reason why this movie is so perfect!<br /><br />I don't give a rat's ass (pardon my French) about to what extend the King Lear story is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say: this movie has changed my life.<br /><br />Keep up the good work guys, you CAN and DO make a difference.<br /><br />\n",
            "2. This is the latest entry in the long series of films with the French agent, O.S.S. 117 (the French answer to James Bond). The series was launched in the early 1950's, and spawned at least eight films (none of which was ever released in the U.S.). 'O.S.S.117:Cairo,Nest Of Spies' is a breezy little comedy that should not...repeat NOT, be taken too seriously. Our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy chase in Egypt (with Morroco doing stand in for Egypt) to find out about a long lost friend. What follows is the standard James Bond/Inspector Cloussou kind of antics. Although our man is something of an overt xenophobe,sexist,homophobe, it's treated as pure farce (as I said, don't take it too seriously). Although there is a bit of rough language & cartoon violence, it's basically okay for older kids (ages 12 & up). As previously stated in the subject line, just sit back,pass the popcorn & just enjoy.\n",
            "3. This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I at least thought I'd be able to stand it. But, I was wrong. First, the weird looping? It was like watching \"America's Funniest Home Videos\". The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it. Now, the final scene transcends, I must say. It's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. What crappy dancing. Horrible and beautiful at once.\n",
            "4. I was truly and wonderfully surprised at \"O' Brother, Where Art Thou?\" The video store was out of all the movies I was planning on renting, so then I came across this. I came home and as I watched I became engrossed and found myself laughing out loud. The Coen's have made a magnificiant film again. But I think the first time you watch this movie, you get to know the characters. The second time, now that you know them, you laugh sooo hard it could hurt you. I strongly would reccomend ANYONE seeing this because if you are not, you are truly missing a film gem for the ages. 10/10\n",
            "5. This movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie, but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time! The trailer makes this out to be a comedy, but the film can't decide if it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a romance or an action film. Press releases indicated that Shatner and Hamlin made this movie because they loved the script (what were they thinking?). If you like William Shatner (I do) see \"Free Enterprise\" instead.\n"
